Learning-to-learn(meta-learning) is a hot research field which treats the learning of the traditional machine learning task as the learning problem. The utility that comes with this specific learning enhances the capability of the machine related prediction tasks by means of increased efficiency of data utilization resulting from the context detection capability of the algorithms presented under this paradigm. Model-Agnostic Machine Learning (MAML)\cite{Finn2017} is one of the recent and most impactful algorithms.
