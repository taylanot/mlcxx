\begin{itemize}
  \item Database creation.
  \item Non-monotonicity of learning curves
  \item Learning curve approximation methods.
  \item Surveys.
  \item Meta-learning learning curves. (Leiden People)
  \item Have not seen anyone doing something like this yet. But talk about the semi-parametric kernel ridge and its applications.
  \item Maybe ties to structured learning and meta-learning if it does not hinder the flow of the paper.
\end{itemize}
