\subsection{Learning Monotone Learning Curves}

\subsubsection{Learning curve prediction for changing hyper-parameters of the same model and same dataset}\label{sec:same}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The results of this experiment I have already shown. 
  \item It is possible to extrapolate with little error
  \item Needs to write the experimentation one last time in a reproducible way.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Learning curve prediction for tuned hyper-parameter of the same model and different datasets}\label{sec:diff-dataset}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We do not have it yet but after the Section \ref{sec:same} experiments are written again it will be easy to obtain.
  \item I suspect this will be a bit more problematic as the tuned curves have a bit different variations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Learning Non-monotone Learning Curves}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We have linear ridge regression for varying lambdas which is non-monotonic.
  \item This method was able to fairly accurately predict even bimodal curves. (Bimodality comes from the different dimensional datasets.
  \item I will take these from Tom. After he comes back he will prepare the already existing non-monotonic examples.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance against baselines}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Here the prediction performance for power-law etc. will be provided.
  \item The difference between the non-monotonic and monotonic predictions will be highlighted.
\end{itemize}
