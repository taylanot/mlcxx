\subsection{Learning Curves for Semiparameteric Kernel Ridge}\label{app:1}
With Synthetic Data.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Show the increased performance compared to standard Kernel Ridge.
  \item Small training set size benefit.
  \item Extrapolation capabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hypothesis Testing for the Semiparametric Kernel Ridge}\label{app:2}
With Synthetic Data.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Only available test for know seems to be Cramer Von Mises statistical test. The reason is we do not know the underlying distribution between resulting risks of the different hypotheses. Moreover, the variance is not the same from the initial experimentation which eliminates almost all the other statistical testing methods.
  \item Here if I have time, might add the work that Rickard and I talked about.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{FPCA for information extraction from the available learning curves}\label{app:3}

With Real Data.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain and show the time benefit.
  \item Explain and show the smoothing benefit.
  \item How to decide on how many components to use.
  \item Mention mean adjustment as it is found to be critical in utilization.
\end{itemize}
