\begin{itemize}
  \item We can accurately predict learning curves with a data-driven approach.
  \item Talk about the caveats: Limitations of the approach, time complexity, choices that have to be made like, how many components, FPCA limitations, and the drawbacks you might observe during the re-experimentation.
  \item Talk about possible extensions like Gaussian Process extension for adding uncertainty to our predictions, might get over-confidence though from my experience with multi-fidelity regression. One additional remark would be to penalize the $\boldsymbol{\beta}$'s. This might pave the way for using the raw learning curves in the prediction without being affected by the noisiness of it. But an additional burden on the model selection can make things a bit difficult again.
