 NAME:  LOW BIRTH WEIGHT DATA
 KEYWORDS:  Logistic Regression
 SIZE:  189 observations, 11 variables
 
 NOTE:
         These data come from Appendix 1 of Hosmer and Lemeshow (1989).
 These data are copyrighted and must be acknowledged and used accordingly.
 
 DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
         The goal of this study was to identify risk factors associated with
 giving birth to a low birth weight baby (weighing less than 2500 grams).
 Data were collected on 189 women, 59 of which had low birth weight babies
 and 130 of which had normal birth weight babies.  Four variables which were
 thought to be of importance were age, weight of the subject at her last
 menstrual period, race, and the number of physician visits during the first
 trimester of pregnancy.
 
 
 SOURCE:
          Data were collected at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield,
 Massachusetts, during 1986.
 
 
 NOTE:
           This data set consists of the complete data.  A paired data set
 created from this low birth weight data may be found in plowbwt.dat and
 a 3 to 1 matched data set created from the low birth weight data may be
 found in mlowbwt.dat.

 PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:
         These data have been used as an example of fitting a multiple
 logistic regression model.
 
 STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
         Low birth weight is an outcome that has been of concern to physicians
 for years. This is due to the fact that infant mortality rates and birth
 defect rates are very high for low birth weight babies. A woman's behavior
 during pregnancy (including diet, smoking habits, and receiving prenatal care)
 can greatly alter the chances of carrying the baby to term and, consequently,
 of delivering a baby of normal birth weight.
         The variables identified in the code sheet given in the table have been
 shown to be associated with low birth weight in the obstetrical literature. The
 goal of the current study was to ascertain if these variables were important
 in the population being served by the medical center where the data were
 collected.
