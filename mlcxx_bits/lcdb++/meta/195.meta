This data set consists of three types of entities:
 (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics;
 (b) its assigned insurance risk rating,;
 (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. 
 The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially
 assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by
 moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process &quot;symboling&quot;. A value of +3 indicates that the auto is
 risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year.
 This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons,
 sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.
 - Note: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a &quot;class&quot; attribute.
 The original data (from the UCI repository) (http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLSummary.html) has 205 instances

 The original data also has some missing attribute values denoted by &quot;?&quot; : 
 
    Attribute #:   Number of instances missing a value:
    2.             41
    6.             2
    19.            4
    20.            4
    22.            2
    23.            2
    26.            4
 
 I've changed the original data in the following way :
 - All instances with unknowns were removed giving 159 instances.
 - The goal variable is &quot;price&quot;
 - All nominal attributes (10) were removed.
