1. Data set title:
Nomao Data Set 


2. Abstract: 
Nomao collects data about places (name, phone, localization...) from many sources. Deduplication consists in detecting what data refer to the same place. Instances in the dataset compare 2 spots.

3. Data Set Characteristics:  

- Univariate
- Area: Computer
- Attribute Characteristics: Real
- Associated Tasks: Classification
- Missing Values?: Yes

5. Data Set Information:

The dataset has been enriched during the Nomao Challenge: organized along with the ALRA workshop (Active Learning in Real-world Applications): held at the ECML-PKDD 2012 conference.

5.1. Number of Instances

34,465 instances, mix of continuous and nominal, labeled by human expert.

First 29,104 instances have been labeled with &quot;human prior&quot;.
See the corresponding article described in section &quot;3. Past Usage&quot; for more details.

Next 917 instances have been labeled using the active learning method called &quot;marg&quot;.
Next 964 instances refer to the active method called &quot;wmarg&quot;.
Next 995 instances refer to the active method called &quot;wmarg5&quot;.
Next 1,985 instances refer to the active method called &quot;rand&quot; (random selection).

Last instances have been labeled during the corresponding challenge.
More details can be found in http://www.nomao.com/labs/challenge
Next 163 instances refer to the active method called &quot;baseline&quot;.
Next 167 instances refer to the active method called &quot;nomao&quot;.
And last 170 instances refer to the active method called &quot;tsun&quot;.

5.2. Number of Attributes 

120 attributes: 89 continuous, 31 nominal (including the attributes 'label' and 'id'). 

The features are separated by comma.

5.3. Attribute Information: 

Missing data are allowed, represented by question marks '?'.

Labels are +1 if the concerned spots must be merged, -1 if they do not refer to the same entity.

1 id: name is composed of the names of the spots that are compared, separated by a sharp (#).
