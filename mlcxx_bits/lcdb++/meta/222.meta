       -- Steve applied his EACH program to predict survival (i.e., life
          or death), did not use the wall-motion attribute, and recorded 87 
          correct and 29 incorrect in an incremental application to this
          database.  He also showed that, by tuning EACH to this domain,
          EACH was able to derive (non-incrementally) a set of 28 
          hyper-rectangles that could perfectly classify 119 instances.

       -- They predicted the same variable (whether patients will live
          one year after a heart attack) using a different set of 345
          instances.  Their statistical test recorded a 61% accuracy
          in predicting that a patient will die (post-hoc fit).
    -- 3. Elvin Kinney (in communication with Steven Salzberg) reported
          that a Cox regression application recorded a 60% accuracy
          in predicting that a patient will die.
 
 4. Relevant Information:
   -- All the patients suffered heart attacks at some point in the past.
      Some are still alive and some are not.  The survival and still-alive
      variables, when taken together, indicate whether a patient survived
      for at least one year following the heart attack.  
 
      The problem addressed by past researchers was to predict from the 
      other variables whether or not the patient will survive at least
      one year.  The most difficult part of this problem is correctly
      predicting that the patient will NOT survive.  (Part of the difficulty
      seems to be the size of the data set.)
 
 5. Number of Instances: 132
 
 6. Number of Attributes: 13 (all numeric-valued)
 
 7. Attribute Information:
    1. survival -- the number of months patient survived (has survived,
                   if patient is still alive).  Because all the patients
                   had their heart attacks at different times, it is 
                   possible that some patients have survived less than
                   one year but they are still alive.  Check the second
                   variable to confirm this.  Such patients cannot be 
                   used for the prediction task mentioned above.
    2. still-alive -- a binary variable.  0=dead at end of survival period,
                      1 means still alive 
    3. age-at-heart-attack -- age in years when heart attack occurred
    4. pericardial-effusion -- binary. Pericardial effusion is fluid
                               around the heart.  0=no fluid, 1=fluid
    5. fractional-shortening -- a measure of contracility around the heart
                                lower numbers are increasingly abnormal
    6. epss -- E-point septal separation, another measure of contractility.  
               Larger numbers are increasingly abnormal.
    7. lvdd -- left ventricular end-diastolic dimension.  This is
               a measure of the size of the heart at end-diastole.
               Large hearts tend to be sick hearts.
    8. wall-motion-score -- a measure of how the segments of the left
                            ventricle are moving
    9. wall-motion-index -- equals wall-motion-score divided by number of
                            segments seen.  Usually 12-13 segments are seen
                            in an echocardiogram.  Use this variable INSTEAD
                            of the wall motion score.
    10. mult -- a derivate var which can be ignored
    11. name -- the name of the patient (I have replaced them with &quot;name&quot;)
    12. group -- meaningless, ignore it
    13. alive-at-1 -- Boolean-valued. Derived from the first two attributes.
                      0 means patient was either dead after 1 year or had
                      been followed for less than 1 year.  1 means patient 
                      was alive at 1 year.
