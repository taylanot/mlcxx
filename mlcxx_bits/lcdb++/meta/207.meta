          -- Predicted price of car using all numeric and Boolean attributes
          -- Method: an instance-based learning (IBL) algorithm derived from a
             localized k-nearest neighbor algorithm.  Compared with a
             linear regression prediction...so all instances
             with missing attribute values were discarded.  This resulted with
             a training set of 159 instances, which was also used as a test
             set (minus the actual instance during testing).
          -- Results: Percent Average Deviation Error of Prediction from Actual
             -- 11.84% for the IBL algorithm
             -- 14.12% for the resulting linear regression equation
 
 4. Relevant Information:
    -- Description
       This data set consists of three types of entities: (a) the
       specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b)
       its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use
       as compared to other cars.  The second rating corresponds to the
       degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates.
       Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its
       price.   Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is
       adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this
       process &quot;symboling&quot;.  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is
       risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.
 
       The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured
       vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a
       particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons,
       sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car
       per year.

             &quot;class&quot; attribute.
