 NAME:  Sexual activity and the lifespan of male fruitflies
 TYPE:  Designed (almost factorial) experiment
 SIZE:  125 observations, 5 variables
 
 DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
 A cost of increased reproduction in terms of reduced longevity has been
 shown for female fruitflies, but not for males.  The flies used were an
 outbred stock.  Sexual activity was manipulated by supplying individual
 males with one or eight receptive virgin females per day.  The
 longevity of these males was compared with that of two control types.
 The first control consisted of two sets of individual males kept with
 one or eight newly inseminated females.  Newly inseminated females will
 not usually remate for at least two days, and thus served as a control
 for any effect of competition with the male for food or space.  The
 second control was a set of individual males kept with no females.
 There were 25 males in each of the five groups, which were treated
 identically in number of anaesthetizations (using CO2) and provision of
 fresh food medium.

 VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
 Columns  Variable    Description
 -------  --------    -----------
  1- 2    ID          Serial No. (1-25) within each group of 25
                      (the order in which data points were abstracted)
 
  4       PARTNERS    Number of companions (0, 1 or 8)
 
  6       TYPE        Type of companion
                        0: newly pregnant female
                        1: virgin female
                        9: not applicable (when PARTNERS=0)
 
  8- 9    LONGEVITY   Lifespan, in days
 
 11-14    THORAX      Length of thorax, in mm (x.xx)
 
 16-17    SLEEP       Percentage of each day spent sleeping
 
 
 SPECIAL NOTES:
 `Compliance' of the males in the two experimental groups was documented
 as follows:  On two days per week throughout the life of each
 experimental male, the females that had been supplied as virgins to
 that male were kept and examined for fertile eggs.  The insemination
 rate declined from approximately 7 females/day at age one week to just
 under 2/day at age eight weeks in the males supplied with eight virgin
 females per day, and from just under 1/day at age one week to
 approximately 0.6/day at age eight weeks in the males supplied with one
 virgin female per day.  These `compliance' data were not supplied for
 individual males, but the authors say that &quot;There were no significant
 differences between the individual males within each experimental
 group.&quot;
 
 STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
 James Hanley found this dataset in _Nature_ and was attracted by the
 way the raw data were presented in classical analysis of covariance
 style in Figure 2.  He read the data points from the graphs and brought
 them to the attention of a colleague with whom he was teaching the
 applied statistics course.  Dr. Liddell thought that with only three
 explanatory variables (THORAX, plus PARTNERS and TYPE to describe the
 five groups), it would not be challenging enough as a data-analysis
 project.  He suggested adding another variable.  James Hanley added
 SLEEP, a variable not mentioned in the published article.  Teachers can
 contact us about the construction of this variable.  (We prefer to
 divulge the details at the end of the data-analysis project.)
 
 Further discussion of the background and pedagogical use of this
 dataset can be found in Hanley (1983) and in Hanley and Shapiro
 (1994).  To obtain the Hanley and Shapiro article, send the one-line

 PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:
 This has been the most successful and the most memorable dataset we
 have used in an &quot;applications of statistics&quot; course, which we have
 taught for ten years.  The most common analysis techniques have been
 analysis of variance, classical analysis of covariance, and multiple
 regression.  Because the variable THORAX is so strong (it explains
 about 1/3 of the variance in LONGEVITY), it is important to consider it
 to increase the precision of between-group contrasts.  When students
 first check and find that the distributions of thorax length, and in
 particular, the mean thorax length, are very similar in the different
 groups, many of them are willing to say (in epidemiological
 terminology) that THORAX is not a confounding variable, and that it can
 be omitted from the analysis.
 
 There is usually lively discussion about the primary contrast.  The
 five groups and their special structure allow opportunities for
 students to understand and verbalize what we mean by the term
 &quot;statistical interaction.&quot;
 
 There is also much debate as to whether one should take the SLEEP
 variable into account.  Some students say that it is an `intermediate'
 variable.  Some students formally test the mean level of SLEEP across
 groups, find one pair where there is a statistically significant
 difference, and want to treat it as a confounding variable.  A few
 students muse about how it was measured.
 
 There is heteroscedasticity in the LONGEVITY variable.
 
 One very observant student (now a professor) argued that THORAX cannot
 be used as a predictor or explanatory variable for the LONGEVITY
 outcome since fruitflies who die young may not be fully grown, i.e., it
 is also an intermediate variable.  One Ph.D. student who had studied
 entomology assured us that fruitflies do not grow longer after birth;
 therefore, the THORAX length is not time-dependent!
 
 Curiously, the dataset has seldom been analyzed using techniques from
 survival analysis.  The fact that there are no censored observations is
 not really an excuse, and one could easily devise a way to introduce
 censoring of LONGEVITY.
