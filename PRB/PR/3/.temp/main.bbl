    Does one need really need boundaries between doctoral supervisor and
  supervisee when talking about mature learners? Drawing on reflection from her
  extensive experience, the author believes it is critical to maintain this
  divide. There is an increase in doctoral students, proliferation of doctoral
  programmes globally and practices which vary from context to context. A
  shared concern, however, is the engagement between the supervisor and the
  supervisee which can often be mutually unsatisfactory. Why is this
  relationship often so problematic for both parties? What kind of relationship
  is most appropriate and beneficial? To what extent does this academic
  engagement need rethinking? These questions are explored with reference to
  roles, expectations and boundaries and the underlying principles of good
  practice.%
