******** INTRODUCTION
- FE2
  * Why it is necessary 
  * How it works
  * Uncertainty of its results, where does it originate?
- Uncertainty quantification
  * Importance (try to tie it with your actual problem)
  * Forms of uncertainty
  * Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty
NOTE: After introducing and tying these topics your reserach questions should be
known by the reader 
******** MAIN
  - Bayesian Methods and Uncertainty Quantification
    * Try to tie methods you will use to Uncertrainty Quantification
    * Lay out Bayesian methods main frame!
  - Gaussian Process
    * Explain how does it fit the above Bayesian framework 
    * Positives and limitations etc
    NOTE: Here everything should be clear on how to train it how model selection is done etc.
  - BNN
    * Explain how does it fit the above Bayesian framework.
    * Positives and limitations etc.
    NOTE: Here everything should be clear on how to train it how model selection is done etc.
  
 - Uncertrainty Quantification
    * Here the posterior predictive distribution sampling and obtaining a pdf at each x should be explained.
******** METHODOLOGY
  * Try to explain your data where does it come form how does it look show it!
  * By providing relavant section give all the details on your experiments and models. (eg. how to get pdf from data, how to tune model, architecture details trainig details all the ml related things you can think off.)
  * Try to use illustrations as much as you can here!
  * Try to tie your research questions to your experiments and lay out which experiements will be done.
******** RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
  * Show your results and report what you found out with a critical eye. 
  * Try your best link your knowledge with what you observe. Refer to your results in a coherent way.
  * NOTE: Here all the research questions should be discussed!
******** CONCLUSION
  * Upon your discussion lay out your conclusions and tiny bit of future work if you can think of it.
