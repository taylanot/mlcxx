#              EXAMPLE FOR 2D RANDOMINCLUSION RVE WITH CIRCLES                 #
################################################################################
# This example shows the generation of an RVE with randomly placed, circular
# inclusions. The basic procedure of the model an mesh generation are pointed
# out and the resulting mesh is visualized. For the example, only the standard
# configuration is used. However, in order to show all available options - user
# configurations are passed as dictionaries to the individual classes and
# methods - the dictionaries containing the default values are passed. This
# means that, if they were not passed, the resulting mesh would be the same.

# Loading of the RandomInclusionRVE class
# Before the model and mesh generation can start, the required class has to be
# loaded. In this case it is the class RandomInclusionRVE
from gmshModel.Model import RandomInclusionRVE

# Initialization of the RVE
# In order to generate a mesh for RVEs with randomly placed inclusions, relevant
# data have to be passed for the initialization of a new object instance. For
# RVEs of the type under consideration, the following parameters are possible:
#
# size: list/array (mandatory)
#   array defining the size of the RVE in the individual directions
#   -> size=[L_x, L_y, L_z]
#
# inclusionSets: list/array (mandatory)
#   array defining the relevant information (radius and amount) for the individual
#   groups of spherical inclusions to be placed
#   -> inclusionSets=[[r_1, n_1] [r_2, n_2], ..., [r_n, n_n]]
#
# inclusionType: string (mandatory)
#   string defining the type of inclusions within the RVE
#
# origin: list/array (optional)
#   array defining the origin of the RVE
#   -> origin=[O_x, O_y, O_z]
#
# periodicityFlags: list/array (optional)
#   array with flags (0/1) whether the current coordinate direction has to be
#   treated as periodic
#   periodicityFlags=[0/1, 0/1, 0/1]
#
# domainGroup: string (optional)
#   string defining which group the geometric objects defining the domain belong
#   to (to reference this group within boolean operations)
#
# inclusionGroup: string (optional)
#   string defining which group the geometric objects defining the inclusions
#   belong to (to reference this group within boolean operations)
#
# gmshConfigChanges: dict (optional)
#   dictionary for user updates of the default Gmsh configuration
#

# Gmsh model generation
# After all parameters for the RVE are set, the Gmsh model can be generated.
# This process involves the definition of geometric objects, their combination
# to more complex shapes using boolean operations and the definition of physical
# groups, i.e. groups of elements that belong to the same material or part of
# the boundary. For RVEs with randomly placed inclusions, only the placement
# options can be changed by the user. To this end, the possible parameters are:
#
# placementOptions: dict (optional)
#   user updates for the inclusion placement algorithm
