# Summary

# Statement of Need
- What is a learning curve. Difference between the training curve. What is a feature curve?
How do we obtain them? What is the bottleneck of these procedures?  Why c++, also comes in useful...

# Usage
- What do we provide? mlpack learners with some more inhouse learners from the prtools type of way and maybe some scikit-learn inspiration. Written using the armadillo library. We provide an connection with highs and openml for seamless connection with a convex optimizer and large database for machine learning tasks.

# Conclusions
- Use it. 

# Declarations

The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.
