  abstract = {A new data-driven computational framework is developed to assist in the design and modeling of new material systems and structures. The proposed framework integrates three general steps: (1) design of experiments, where the input variables describing material geometry (microstructure), phase properties and external conditions are sampled; (2) efficient computational analyses of each design sample, leading to the creation of a material response database; and (3) machine learning applied to this database to obtain a new design or response model.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the performance of a recent homogenized orthotropic plasticity model for fiber reinforced composites (Vogler et~al. (2013)) is investigated by comparing the model response against a micromechanical model. It is assumed that the micromechanical model which contains a recent plasticity model for polymers (Melro et~al. (2013a,b)) offers a realistic representation of the plastic deformation of composite materials. Under that assumption, the performance of the homogenized model can be assessed based on the question how well it reproduces micromechanical results. Improved consistent tangent formulations for both plasticity models are presented and a study into the representative volume element size for elasto-plastic micromechanical analysis is performed. Micromechanical simulations of basic load cases are used to generate input for the homogenized model. Next, the response of the two models is compared for a range of different load cases. The loss of accuracy due to necessary simplifications in the homogenized model is quantified in the comparison. These simplifications in the mesomodel include ignoring the stress in fiber direction, disregarding the influence stress orientation under combined longitudinal shear and transverse loading, and the use of a single constant plastic Poisson ratio.},
