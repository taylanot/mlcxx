## About  

`lcpp` is designed to help you easily generate learning curves for supervised ML algorithms.  
It provides a clean C++ header-only implementation, making it easy to integrate into your own projects without heavy build setup.

## Examples 
Some examples are provided in the examples directory. They are self-explanatory: When you crate the 
 
## Quick Start  

Get started quickly with **lcpp**.

1. **Run the installer** (optional) to set up everything locally:
```bash
./install.sh
```
2. Pull the pre-built Singularity image if you prefer not to install manually:
```bash
singularity pull lcpp.sif docker://taylanot/lcpp
```
3. Include **lcpp** in your program by adding this at the top of your source file:
```cpp
#include <lcpp.h>
```

4. Build your project using the provided sample Makefile. This will create a build directory and place your executable there:
```bash
singularity lcpp.sif make your_project
```

4. Now you are ready to run you program...
```bash
build/your_project
```
