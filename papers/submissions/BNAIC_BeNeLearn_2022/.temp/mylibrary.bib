  abstract = {We introduce a method to provide vectorial representations of visual classification tasks which can be used to reason about the nature of those tasks and their relations. Given a dataset with ground-truth labels and a loss function defined over those labels, we process images through a ``probe network'' and compute an embedding based on estimates of the Fisher information matrix associated with the probe network parameters. This provides a fixed-dimensional embedding of the task that is independent of details such as the number of classes and does not require any understanding of the class label semantics. We demonstrate that this embedding is capable of predicting task similarities that match our intuition about semantic and taxonomic relations between different visual tasks (e.g., tasks based on classifying different types of plants are similar). We also demonstrate the practical value of this framework for the meta-task of selecting a pre-trained feature extractor for a new task. We present a simple meta-learning framework for learning a metric on embeddings that is capable of predicting which feature extractors will perform well. Selecting a feature extractor with task embedding obtains a performance close to the best available feature extractor, while costing substantially less than exhaustively training and evaluating on all available feature extractors.},

Recently, much work has been devoted to kernel learning, that is, the problem of finding a good kernel matrix for a given task. This can be done in a semi-supervised learning setting by using a large set of unlabeled data and a (typically small) set of i.i.d. labeled data. Another, even more challenging problem, is how one can exploit partially labeled data of a source task to learn good representations for a different, but related, target task. This is the main subject of transfer learning.},

Our learned algorithms, implemented by LSTMs, outperform generic, hand-designed competitors on the tasks for which they are trained, and also generalize well to new tasks with similar structure.

Model Agnostic Meta Learning or MAML is currently one of the best approaches for few-shot learning via meta-learning. MAML is simple, elegant and very powerful, however, it has a variety of issues, such as being very sensitive to neural network architectures, often leading to instability during training, requiring arduous hyperparameter searches to stabilize training and achieve high generalization and being very computationally expensive at both training and inference times. In this paper, we propose various modifications to MAML that not only stabilize the system, but also substantially improve the generalization performance, convergence speed and computational overhead of MAML, which we call MAML++.},

The resistivity of this film is described by the first quantum theory of resistivity of nano-scale metallic connectors [R C Munoz               et al               , App. Phys. Rev.               4               (2017) 011102]. We also report an improved version of this theory that includes a new analytical description of the effect of grain boundary disorder on electron transport. We employ the surface roughness and grain size distribution measured on this Cu film as input data to compute, using our heory, the room temperature resistivity of Cu wires of rectangular cross section, and compare with the resistivity of these wires reported in the literature [M H Van der Veen               et al               , 2018 IEEE International Interconnect Technology Conference (IITC) (2018)], that are used for designing Integrated Circuits (IC) for the 14 nm, 10 nm, 7 nm, 5 nm, 3 nm and 2 nm nodes, respectively. The quantum theory predicts an increase in resistivity with diminishing wire dimensions that accurately agrees with the room temperature resistivity measured on these Cu wires. The resistivity induced by electron-rough surface scattering accounts for about half of the increase over the bulk observed in the 3 nm and 2 nm tech node; scattering by non-uniform grain boundaries contributes the remaining increase in resistivity\textemdash the latter is responsible for the weak Anderson localization. According to the description of electron motion furnished by this improved quantum theory, the break down of Moore's law with shrinking wire dimensions is to be expected, since it               originates from size effects triggered by electron scattering with rough surfaces and scattering by non-equally spaced grain boundaries, which become dominant as the dimensions of the metallic wire shrinks.},

  abstract = {It is known that the solution of regularization and interpolation problems with Hilbertian penalties can be expressed as a linear combination of the data. This very useful property, called the representer theorem, has been widely studied and applied to machine learning problems. Analogous optimality conditions have appeared in other contexts, notably in matrix regularization. In this paper we propose a unified view, which generalizes the concept of representer theorems and extends necessary and sufficient conditions for such theorems to hold. Our main result shows a close connection between representer theorems and certain classes of regularization penalties, which we call orthomonotone functions. This result not only subsumes previous representer theorems as special cases but also yields a new class of optimality conditions, which goes beyond the classical linear combination of the data. Moreover, orthomonotonicity provides a useful criterion for testing whether a representer theorem holds for a specific regularization problem.},

It is based on a novel non-convex regularizer which controls the number of learned features common across the tasks. We prove that the method is equivalent to solving a convex optimization problem for which there is an iterative algorithm which converges to an optimal solution. The algorithm has a simple interpretation: it alternately performs a supervised and an unsupervised step, where in the former step it learns task-specific functions and in the latter step it learns common-across-tasks sparse representations for these functions. We also provide an extension of the algorithm which learns sparse nonlinear representations using kernels. We report experiments on simulated and real data sets which demonstrate that the proposed method can both improve the performance relative to learning each task independently and lead to a few learned features common across related tasks. Our algorithm can also be used, as a special case, to simply select \textendash{} not learn \textendash{} a few common variables across the tasks3.},

Nonetheless, we have just started to understand and analyze how they are able to adapt fast to new tasks. In this work, we contribute by conducting a series of empirical and theoretical studies, and discover several interesting, previously unknown properties of the algorithm. First, we find MAML adapts better with a deep architecture even if the tasks need only a shallow one. Secondly, linear layers can be added to the output layers of a shallower model to increase the depth without altering the modelling capacity, leading to improved performance in adaptation. Alternatively, an external and separate neural network metaoptimizer can also be used to transform the gradient updates of a smaller model so as to obtain improved performances in adaptation. Drawing from these evidences, we theorize that for a deep neural network to meta-learn well, the upper layers must transform the gradients of the bottom layers as if the upper layers were an external meta-optimizer, operating on a smaller network that is composed of the bottom layers.},

Such a problem arises, for example, when observations of the label variable are costly and may require a skilled human agent. When the conditional expectation ErY |Xs is not exactly linear, one can consider the best linear approximation to the conditional expectation, which can be estimated consistently by the least squares estimates (LSE). The latter depends only on the labeled data. We suggest improved alternative estimates to the LSE that use also the unlabeled data. Our estimation method can be easily implemented and has simply described asymptotic properties. The new estimates asymptotically dominate the usual standard procedures under certain non-linearity condition of ErY |Xs; otherwise, they are asymptotically equivalent. The performance of the new estimator for small sample size is investigated in an extensive simulation study. A real data example of inferring homeless population is used to illustrate the new methodology.},

Typically such bias is supplied by hand through the skill and insights of experts. In this paper a model for automatically learning bias is investigated. The central assumption of the model is that the learner is embedded within an environment of related learning tasks. Within such an environment the learner can sample from multiple tasks, and hence it can search for a hypothesis space that contains good solutions to many of the problems in the environment. Under certain restrictions on the set of all hypothesis spaces available to the learner, we show that a hypothesis space that performs well on a sufficiently large number of training tasks will also perform well when learning novel tasks in the same environment. Explicit bounds are also derived demonstrating that learning multiple tasks within an environment of related tasks can potentially give much better generalization than learning a single task.},

Our results with the Omniglot database demonstrate a substantial reduction in the need to tune MAML training hyperparameters and improvement to training stability with less sensitivity to hyperparameter choice.},

  abstract = {Deep learning models require a large amount of data to perform well. When data is scarce for a target task, we can transfer the knowledge gained by training on similar tasks to quickly learn the target. A successful approach is meta-learning, or learning to learn a distribution of tasks, where learning is represented by an outer loop, and to learn by an inner loop of gradient descent. However, a number of recent empirical studies argue that the inner loop is unnecessary and more simple models work equally well or even better. We study the performance of MAML as a function of the learning rate of the inner loop, where zero learning rate implies that there is no inner loop. Using random matrix theory and exact solutions of linear models, we calculate an algebraic expression for the test loss of MAML applied to mixed linear regression and nonlinear regression with overparameterized models. Surprisingly, while the optimal learning rate for adaptation is positive, we find that the optimal learning rate for training is always negative, a setting that has never been considered before. Therefore, not only does the performance increase by decreasing the learning rate to zero, as suggested by recent work, but it can be increased even further by decreasing the learning rate to negative values. These results help clarify under what circumstances meta-learning performs best.},

  abstract = {Adapting deep networks to new concepts from a few examples is challenging, due to the high computational requirements of standard fine-tuning procedures. Most work on few-shot learning has thus focused on simple learning techniques for adaptation, such as nearest neighbours or gradient descent. Nonetheless, the machine learning literature contains a wealth of methods that learn non-deep models very efficiently. In this paper, we propose to use these fast convergent methods as the main adaptation mechanism for few-shot learning. The main idea is to teach a deep network to use standard machine learning tools, such as ridge regression, as part of its own internal model, enabling it to quickly adapt to novel data. This requires back-propagating errors through the solver steps. While normally the cost of the matrix operations involved in such a process would be significant, by using the Woodbury identity we can make the small number of examples work to our advantage. We propose both closed-form and iterative solvers, based on ridge regression and logistic regression components. Our methods constitute a simple and novel approach to the problem of few-shot learning and achieve performance competitive with or superior to the state of the art on three benchmarks.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a machine learning framework (GP-NODE) for Bayesian systems identification from partial, noisy and irregular observations of nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed method takes advantage of recent developments in differentiable programming to propagate gradient information through ordinary differential equation solvers and perform Bayesian inference with respect to unknown model parameters using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling and Gaussian Process priors over the observed system states. This allows us to exploit temporal correlations in the observed data, and efficiently infer posterior distributions over plausible models with quantified uncertainty. Moreover, the use of sparsity-promoting priors such as the Finnish Horseshoe for free model parameters enables the discovery of interpretable and parsimonious representations for the underlying latent dynamics. A series of numerical studies is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GP-NODE method including predatorprey systems, systems biology, and a 50-dimensional human motion dynamical system. Taken together, our findings put forth a novel, flexible and robust workflow for data-driven model discovery under uncertainty.

  abstract = {The classical approach to the acquisition of knowledge in artificial intelligence has been to program the intelligence into the machine in the form of specific rules for the application of the knowledge: expert systems. Unfortunately, the amount of time and resources required to program an expert system with sufficient knowledge for non-trivial problem-solving is prohibitively large. An alternative approach is to allow the machine to learn the rules based upon trial-and-error interaction with the environment, much as humans do. This will require endowing the machine with a sophisticated set of sensors for the perception of the external world, the ability to generate trial actions based upon this perceived information, and a dynamic evaluation policy to allow it to measure the effectiveness of its trial actions and modify its repertoire accordingly. The principles underlying this paradigm, known as collective learning systems theory, have already been applied to sophisticated gaming problems, demonstrating robust learning and dynamic adaptivity. The fundamental building block of a collective learning system is the learning cell, which may be embedded in a massively parallel, hierarchical data communications network. Such a network comprising 100 million learning cells will approach the intelligence capacity of the human cortex. In the not-too-distant future, it may be possible to build a race of robotic slaves to perform a wide variety of tasks in our culture. This goal, while irresistibly attractive, is most certainly fraught with severe social, political, moral, and economic difficulties.},

The wide applicability of this model is illustrated in this paper with several real examples. The chemometrics community has developed several empirical methods to estimate the latent structure in this model, including partial least squares regression \v{Z}PLS. and principal components regression \v{Z}PCR.. However, the majority of the statistical work in this area relies on the standard or reduced rank regression models, thus ignoring the latent variable nature of the X data. Considering methods like PLS and PCR in the context of these models has led to some misleading conclusions. This paper reaffirms the claim made frequently in the chemometrics literature that the reason PLS and PCR have been successful is that they take into account the latent variable structure in the data. It is also shown through several examples that the LVMR model provides the means to model more effectively many datasets in applied science resulting in improved techniques for process monitoring, experimental design and prediction. The focus in this paper is on the general model rather than on parameter estimation methods. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this work, we provide a general framework for meta-learning based on weighting the loss of different source tasks, where the weights are allowed to depend on the target samples. In this general setting, we provide upper bounds on the distance of the weighted empirical risk of the source tasks and expected target risk in terms of an integral probability metric (IPM) and Rademacher complexity, which apply to a number of meta-learning settings including MAML and a weighted MAML variant. We then develop a learning algorithm based on minimizing the error bound with respect to an empirical IPM, including a weighted MAML algorithm, {$\alpha$}-MAML. Finally, we demonstrate empirically on several regression problems that our weighted metalearning algorithm is able to find better initializations than uniformly-weighted meta-learning algorithms, such as MAML.},

In PINNs, automatic differentiation is leveraged to evaluate differential operators without discretization errors, and a multitask learning problem is defined in order to simultaneously fit observed data while respecting the underlying governing laws of physics. Here, we present applications of PINNs to various prototype heat transfer problems, targeting in particular realistic conditions not readily tackled with traditional computational methods. To this end, we first consider forced and mixed convection with unknown thermal boundary conditions on the heated surfaces and aim to obtain the temperature and velocity fields everywhere in the domain, including the boundaries, given some sparse temperature measurements. We also consider the prototype Stefan problem for two-phase flow, aiming to infer the moving interface, the velocity and temperature fields everywhere as well as the different conductivities of a solid and a liquid phase, given a few temperature measurements inside the domain. Finally, we present some realistic industrial applications related to power electronics to highlight the practicality of PINNs as well as the effective use of neural networks in solving general heat transfer problems of industrial complexity. Taken together, the results presented herein demonstrate that PINNs not only can solve ill-posed problems, which are beyond the reach of traditional computational methods, but they can also bridge the gap between computational and experimental heat transfer.},

We first study the benefit of the biased OFUL algorithm in terms of regret minimization. We then propose two strategies to estimate the bias within the learning-to-learn setting.

  abstract = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for time dependent and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. The original empirical interpolation method (EIM) is a modification of POD that reduces the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of time dependent PDEs and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of the EIM in a finite-dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the one-dimensional FitzHugh\textendash Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captures nonlinear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results.},

The former model's strain-energy function, which has the form of a polynomial function, is frequently formulated based on strain invariants. This contribution uses two machine learning (ML) approaches such as linear regression (LR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to identify the materials parameters in the incompressible isotropic elastic strain-energy function. By applying a curve fitting procedure on Treloar's experimental dataset (Treloar, 1976), the optimal materials parameters and their corresponding relative error can be determined by minimizing the least square error between the predicted curve and experimental data. Resultantly, the identified material parameters from both methods are nearly the same and fit well with the experimental data. Generalized Rivlin Model (Rivlin and Saunders, 1951) shows the ability to well capture the large strain of Treloar's rubber-like materials data, and multiple sets of optimal parameters occurred during the fitting process. Furthermore, the relative errors computed using ML methods are better than that of literature around 66,667\% of test cases. For this small dataset, LR shows its advantage over ANN in terms of computational resources, however, significant superiority of ANN will exhibit when dealing with large-scale datasets.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

However, because of the difference of class distribution between meta-training and meta-test domain, the domain shift occurs in multi-modal meta-learning setting. To improve the performance on multi-modal tasks, we propose multi-initialization meta-learning with domain adaptation (MIML-DA) to tackle such domain shift. MIML-DA consists of a modulation network and a novel meta separation network (MSN), where the modulation network is to encode tasks into common and private modulation vectors, and then MSN uses these vectors separately to update the cross-domain meta-learner via a double-gradient descent process. In addition, the regularization using inequality measure is considered to improve the generalization ability of the meta-learner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our MIML-DA method to new multi-modal tasks.},

  abstract = {A priori model reduction methods based on separated representations are introduced for the prediction of the low frequency response of uncertain structures within a parametric stochastic framework. The proper generalized decomposition method is used to construct a quasi-optimal separated representation of the random solution at some frequency samples. At each frequency, an accurate representation of the solution is obtained on reduced bases of spatial functions and stochastic functions. An extraction of the deterministic bases allows for the generation of a global reduced basis yielding a reduced order model of the uncertain structure, which appears to be accurate on the whole frequency band under study and for all values of input random parameters. This strategy can be seen as an alternative to traditional constructions of reduced order models in structural dynamics in the presence of parametric uncertainties. This reduced order model can then be used for further analyses such as the computation of the response at unresolved frequencies or the computation of more accurate stochastic approximations at some frequencies of interest. Because the dynamic response is highly nonlinear with respect to the input random parameters, a second level of separation of variables is introduced for the representation of functions of multiple random parameters, thus allowing the introduction of very fine approximations in each parametric dimension even when dealing with high parametric dimension.

These kernel methods were developed during the last decade and are inspired by convex risk minimization in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. One leading example is support vector regression. We first describe the relationship between the loss function \$L\$ of the KBR method and the tail of the response variable. We then establish the \$L\$-risk consistency for KBR which gives the mathematical justification for the statement that these methods are able to ``learn''. Then we consider robustness properties of such kernel methods. In particular, our results allow us to choose the loss function and the kernel to obtain computationally tractable and consistent KBR methods that have bounded influence functions. Furthermore, bounds for the bias and for the sensitivity curve, which is a finite sample version of the influence function, are developed, and the relationship between KBR and classical \$M\$ estimators is discussed.},

However, these methods only aim to perform well in expectation over tasks coming from some particular distribution that is typically equivalent across meta-training and meta-testing, rather than considering worst-case task performance. In this work we introduce the notion of ``task-robustness'' by reformulating the popular Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) objective [Finn et al., 2017] such that the goal is to minimize the maximum loss over the observed meta-training tasks. The solution to this novel formulation is task-robust in the sense that it places equal importance on even the most difficult and/or rare tasks. This also means that it performs well over all distributions of the observed tasks, making it robust to shifts in the task distribution between meta-training and meta-testing. We present an algorithm to solve the proposed min-max problem, and show that it converges to an -accurate point at the optimal rate of O(1/ 2) in the convex setting and to an ( , {$\delta$})-stationary point at the rate of O(max\{1/ 5, 1/{$\delta$}5\}) in nonconvex settings. We also provide an upper bound on the new task generalization error that captures the advantage of minimizing the worst-case task loss, and demonstrate this advantage in sinusoid regression and image classification experiments.},

However, the MAML objective is significantly more difficult to optimize compared to standard non-adaptive learning (NAL), and little is understood about how much MAML improves over NAL in terms of the fast adaptability of their solutions in various scenarios. We analytically address this issue in a linear regression setting consisting of a mixture of easy and hard tasks, where hardness is related to the rate that gradient descent converges on the task. Specifically, we prove that in order for MAML to achieve substantial gain over NAL, (i) there must be some discrepancy in hardness among the tasks, and (ii) the optimal solutions of the hard tasks must be closely packed with the center far from the center of the easy tasks optimal solutions. We also give numerical and analytical results suggesting that these insights apply to two-layer neural networks. Finally, we provide few-shot image classification experiments that support our insights for when MAML should be used and emphasize the importance of training MAML on hard tasks in practice.},

We invoke machine learning to establish the input-output causality of the RVE boundary value problem using a neural network framework. This renders the RVE as a blackbox which gets the information from the macroscale as an input and gives information back to the macroscale as output, thereby eliminating the need for on-the-fly finite element solves at the RVE level.

  abstract = {Transfer learning has been demonstrated to be effective for many real-world applications as it exploits knowledge present in labeled training data from a source domain to enhance a model's performance in a target domain, which has little or no labeled target training data. Utilizing a labeled source, or auxiliary, domain for aiding a target task can greatly reduce the cost and effort of collecting sufficient training labels to create an effective model in the new target distribution. Currently, most transfer learning methods assume the source and target domains consist of the same feature spaces which greatly limits their applications. This is because it may be difficult to collect auxiliary labeled source domain data that shares the same feature space as the target domain. Recently, heterogeneous transfer learning methods have been developed to address such limitations. This, in effect, expands the application of transfer learning to many other real-world tasks such as cross-language text categorization, text-to-image classification, and many others. Heterogeneous transfer learning is characterized by the source and target domains having differing feature spaces, but may also be combined with other issues such as differing data distributions and label spaces. These can present significant challenges, as one must develop a method to bridge the feature spaces, data distributions, and other gaps which may be present in these cross-domain learning tasks. This paper contributes a comprehensive survey and analysis of current methods designed for performing heterogeneous transfer learning tasks to provide an updated, centralized outlook into current methodologies.},

In this paper, we use biased regularized least squares as a simple yet effective method to transfer the knowledge from one learner to another, and to assess its accuracy. We achieve this by further generalizing a semi-supervised learning method, which we previously introduced. We will show that, with this approach, the teacher can be any classifier. In particular, we will employ the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) as teacher to assess the method's capability in transfering the knowledge in terms of classification accuracy, and in reproducing the probabilities coming from RVM. We validate the method against standard UCI datasets and systematically compare it with Vapnik's original method in terms of accuracy and execution time. We thus demonstrate the feasibility and speed of this new approach.},

The goal addressed in LTL is to select an algorithm that works well on tasks sampled from a meta-distribution. In this work, we consider the family of algorithms given by a variant of Ridge Regression, in which the regularizer is the square distance to an unknown mean vector. We show that, in this setting, the LTL problem can be reformulated as a Least Squares (LS) problem and we exploit a novel metaalgorithm to efficiently solve it. At each iteration the meta-algorithm processes only one dataset. Specifically, it firstly estimates the stochastic LS objective function, by splitting this dataset into two subsets used to train and test the inner algorithm, respectively. Secondly, it performs a stochastic gradient step with the estimated value. Under specific assumptions, we present a bound for the generalization error of our meta-algorithm, which suggests the right splitting parameter to choose. When the hyper-parameters of the problem are fixed, this bound is consistent as the number of tasks grows, even if the sample size is kept constant. Preliminary experiments confirm our theoretical findings, highlighting the advantage of our approach, with respect to independent task learning.},

  abstract = {In learning-to-learn the goal is to infer a learning algorithm that works well on a class of tasks sampled from an unknown meta distribution. In contrast to previous work on batch learning-tolearn, we consider a scenario where tasks are presented sequentially and the algorithm needs to adapt incrementally to improve its performance on future tasks. Key to this setting is for the algorithm to rapidly incorporate new observations into the model as they arrive, without keeping them in memory. We focus on the case where the underlying algorithm is Ridge Regression parameterized by a positive semidefinite matrix.

We study the statistical properties of the proposed algorithm and prove non-asymptotic bounds on its excess transfer risk, that is, the generalization performance on new tasks from the same meta distribution.

  abstract = {Biased regularization and fine-tuning are two recent meta-learning approaches. They have been shown to be effective to tackle distributions of tasks, in which the tasks' target vectors are all close to a common meta-parameter vector. However, these methods may perform poorly on heterogeneous environments of tasks, where the complexity of the tasks' distribution cannot be captured by a single meta-parameter vector. We address this limitation by conditional meta-learning, inferring a conditioning function mapping task's side information into a meta-parameter vector that is appropriate for that task at hand. We characterize properties of the environment under which the conditional approach brings a substantial advantage over standard meta-learning and we highlight examples of environments, such as those with multiple clusters, satisfying these properties. We then propose a convex meta-algorithm providing a comparable advantage also in practice. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings.},

We study environments in which our conditional strategy outperforms standard meta-learning, such as those in which tasks can be organized in separate clusters according to the representation they share.

Perhaps the recent advances that are driving other technical fields are not sufficiently distinguished from long-known informatics methods for materials, thereby masking their likely impact to the materials, processes, and structures engineering (MPSE). Alternatively, the diverse nature and limited availability of relevant materials data pose obstacles to machine-learning implementation. The glimpse captured in this overview is intended to draw focus to selected distinguishing advances, and to show that there are opportunities for these new technologies to have transformational impacts on MPSE. Further, there are opportunities for the MPSE fields to contribute understanding to the emerging machine-learning tools from a physics basis. We suggest that there is an immediate need to expand the use of these new tools throughout MPSE, and to begin the transformation of engineering education that is necessary for ongoing adoption of the methods.},

By overcoming these challenges not only we provide the first theoretical guarantees for MAML and FO-MAML in nonconvex settings, but also we answer some of the unanswered questions for the implementation of these algorithms including how to choose their learning rate and the batch size for both tasks and datasets corresponding to tasks. In particular, we show that MAML can find an -first-order stationary point ( -FOSP) for any positive after at most O(1/ 2) iterations at the expense of requiring second-order information. We also show that FO-MAML which ignores the second-order information required in the update of MAML cannot achieve any small desired level of accuracy, i.e., FO-MAML cannot find an -FOSP for any {$>$} 0. We further propose a new variant of the MAML algorithm called Hessian-free MAML which preserves all theoretical guarantees of MAML, without requiring access to second-order information.},

However, a critical challenge in few-shot learning is task ambiguity: even when a powerful prior can be meta-learned from a large number of prior tasks, a small dataset for a new task can simply be too ambiguous to acquire a single model (e.g., a classifier) for that task that is accurate. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic meta-learning algorithm that can sample models for a new task from a model distribution. Our approach extends model-agnostic meta-learning, which adapts to new tasks via gradient descent, to incorporate a parameter distribution that is trained via a variational lower bound. At meta-test time, our algorithm adapts via a simple procedure that injects noise into gradient descent, and at meta-training time, the model is trained such that this stochastic adaptation procedure produces samples from the approximate model posterior. Our experimental results show that our method can sample plausible classifiers and regressors in ambiguous few-shot learning problems. We also show how reasoning about ambiguity can also be used for downstream active learning problems.},

Two distinct research paradigms have studied this question. Meta-learning views this problem as learning a prior over model parameters that is amenable for fast adaptation on a new task, but typically assumes the tasks are available together as a batch. In contrast, online (regret based) learning considers a setting where tasks are revealed one after the other, but conventionally trains a single model without task-specific adaptation. This work introduces an online meta-learning setting, which merges ideas from both paradigms to better capture the spirit and practice of continual lifelong learning. We propose the follow the meta leader (FTML) algorithm which extends the MAML algorithm to this setting. Theoretically, this work provides an O(log T ) regret guarantee with one additional higher order smoothness assumption (in comparison to the standard online setting). Our experimental evaluation on three different largescale problems suggest that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms alternatives based on traditional online learning approaches.},

Typically, previous works have approached this issue either by attempting to train a neural network that directly produces updates or by attempting to learn better initialisations or scaling factors for a gradient-based update rule. Both of these approaches pose challenges. On one hand, directly producing an update forgoes a useful inductive bias and can easily lead to non-converging behaviour. On the other hand, approaches that try to control a gradient-based update rule typically resort to computing gradients through the learning process to obtain their metagradients, leading to methods that can not scale beyond few-shot task adaptation. In this work, we propose Warped Gradient Descent (WarpGrad), a method that intersects these approaches to mitigate their limitations. WarpGrad meta-learns an efficiently parameterised preconditioning matrix that facilitates gradient descent across the task distribution. Preconditioning arises by interleaving non-linear layers, referred to as warp-layers, between the layers of a task-learner. Warp-layers are meta-learned without backpropagating through the task training process in a manner similar to methods that learn to directly produce updates. WarpGrad is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and can scale to arbitrarily large meta-learning problems. We provide a geometrical interpretation of the approach and evaluate its effectiveness in a variety of settings, including few-shot, standard supervised, continual and reinforcement learning.},

First, we consider the direct approach of modeling the components of the Cauchy stress tensor as a function of the components of the Finger stretch tensor in a Gaussian process. We then consider an improvement on this approach that embeds rotational invariance of the stress-stretch constitutive relation in the GPR representation. This approach requires fewer training examples and achieves higher accuracy while maintaining invariance to rotations exactly. Finally, we consider an approach that recovers the strain-energy density function and derives the stress tensor from this potential. Although the error of this model for predicting the stress tensor is higher, the strain-energy density is recovered with high accuracy from limited training data. The approaches presented here are examples of physics-informed machine learning. They go beyond purely data-driven approaches by embedding the physical system constraints directly into the Gaussian process representation of materials models.},

  abstract = {In meta-learning, the knowledge learned from previous tasks is transferred to new ones, but this transfer only works if tasks are related. Sharing information between unrelated tasks might hurt performance, and it is unclear how to transfer knowledge across tasks with a hierarchical structure. Our research extends a model agnostic meta-learning model, MAML, by exploiting hierarchical task relationships. Our algorithm, TreeMAML, adapts the model to each task with a few gradient steps, but the adaptation follows the hierarchical tree structure: in each step, gradients are pooled across tasks clusters, and subsequent steps follow down the tree. We also implement a clustering algorithm that generates the tasks tree without previous knowledge of the task structure, allowing us to make use of implicit relationships between the tasks. We show that the new algorithm, which we term TreeMAML, performs better than MAML when the task structure is hierarchical for synthetic experiments. To study the performance of the method in real-world data, we apply this method to Natural Language Understanding, we use our algorithm to finetune Language Models taking advantage of the language phylogenetic tree. We show that TreeMAML improves the state of the art results for cross-lingual Natural Language Inference. This result is useful, since most languages in the world are under-resourced and the improvement on cross-lingual transfer allows the internationalization of NLP models. This results open the window to use this algorithm in other realworld hierarchical datasets.},

  abstract = {TO date, material modeling has involved the development of mathematical models of material behavior derived from human observation of, and reasoning with, experimental data. An alternative, discussed in this paper, is to use a computation and knowledge representation paradigm, called neural networks, developed by researchers in connectionism (a subfield of artificial intelligence) to model material behavior. The main benefits in using a neural-network approach are that all behavior can be represented within a unified environment of a neural network and that the network is built directly from experimental data using the self-organizing capabilities of the neural network, i.e., the network is presented with the experimental data and "learns" the relationships between stresses and strains. Such a modeling strategy has important implications for modeling the behavior of modern, complex materials, such as composites. In this paper, the behaviors of concrete in the state of plane stress under monotonic biaxial loading and compressive uniaxial cycle loading are modeled with a back-propagation neural network. The preliminary results of using neural networks to model materials look very promising.},

For this purpose, we collect samples from a standard full order FEM analysis in the offline phase and cluster them using a novel k-means clustering algorithm. The POD and the DEIM algorithms are then employed to construct a corresponding reduced order model. In the online phase, a sample from the current state of the system is passed, at each time step, to a nearest neighbor classifier in which the cluster that best describes it is identified. The force vector and its derivative with respect to the displacement vector are approximated using DEIM, and the system of nonlinear equations is projected onto a lower dimensional subspace using the POD-G. The constructed reduced order model is applied to two typical solid mechanics problems showing strain-localization (a tensile bar and a wall under compression) and a three-dimensional squarefooting problem.},

  abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a new physics informed neural network (PINN) algorithm for solving brittle fracture problems. While most of the PINN algorithms available in the literature minimize the residual of the governing partial differential equation, the proposed approach takes a different path by minimizing the variational energy of the system. Additionally, we modify the neural network output such that the boundary conditions associated with the problem are exactly satisfied. Compared to the conventional residual based PINN, the proposed approach has two major advantages. First, the imposition of boundary conditions is relatively simpler and more robust. Second, the order of derivatives present in the functional form of the variational energy is of lower order than in the residual form used in conventional PINN and hence, training the network is faster. To compute the total variational energy of the system, an efficient scheme that takes as input a geometry described by spline based CAD model and employs Gauss quadrature rules for numerical integration, has been proposed. Moreover, we note that for obtaining the crack path, the proposed PINN has to be trained at each load/displacement step, which can potentially make the algorithm computationally inefficient. To address this issue, we propose to use the concept `transfer learning' wherein, instead of re-training the complete network, we only re-train the network partially while keeping the weights and the biases corresponding to the other portions fixed. With this setup, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach is significantly enhanced. The proposed approach is used to solve six fracture mechanics problems. For all the examples, results obtained using the proposed approach match closely with the results available in the literature. For the first two examples, we compare the results obtained using the proposed approach with the conventional residual based neural network results. For both the problems, the proposed approach is found to yield better accuracy compared to conventional residual based PINN algorithms.},

In contrast to prior methods for meta-learning via hierarchical Bayes, MAML is naturally applicable to complex function approximators through its use of a scalable gradient descent procedure for posterior inference. Furthermore, the identification of MAML as hierarchical Bayes provides a way to understand the algorithm's operation as a meta-learning procedure, as well as an opportunity to make use of computational strategies for efficient inference. We use this opportunity to propose an improvement to the MAML algorithm that makes use of techniques from approximate inference and curvature estimation.},

  abstract = {In this work we study generalization of neural networks in gradient-based metalearning by analyzing various properties of the objective landscapes. We experimentally demonstrate that as meta-training progresses, the meta-test solutions, obtained after adapting the meta-train solution of the model, to new tasks via few steps of gradient-based fine-tuning, become flatter, lower in loss, and further away from the meta-train solution. We also show that those meta-test solutions become flatter even as generalization starts to degrade, thus providing an experimental evidence against the correlation between generalization and flat minima in the paradigm of gradient-based meta-leaning. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that generalization to new tasks is correlated with the coherence between their adaptation trajectories in parameter space, measured by the average cosine similarity between task-specific trajectory directions, starting from a same meta-train solution. We also show that coherence of meta-test gradients, measured by the average inner product between the task-specific gradient vectors evaluated at meta-train solution, is also correlated with generalization. Based on these observations, we propose a novel regularizer for MAML and provide experimental evidence for its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The present paper is focused on the development of a constitutive model for the computational analysis of the mechanical behaviour of hyperelastic materials. One of the main obstacles in solving nonlinear elastic problems is the constitutive equation that must be as simple as possible but also realistic in the large strain range, especially for engineering purposes. Gao has proposed a relatively simple model that shows a good performance in tension as well as in compression. In this paper, the capabilities of Gao\~Os model have been discussed. Three sets of experimental data of different types of deformation are used to identify the model parameters. Numerical simulations are in good agreement with experimental data. Comparisons with Ogden\~Os formula and Mooney\textendash Rivlin\~Os formula by means of a theoretical and a numerical analysis demonstrate that Gao\~Os model performs well for the description of hyperelastic material behaviour and covers a very large range of deformation. Another advantage of this model is that it only needs two parameters to predict the mechanical behaviour of hyperelastic materials. As an application, a singular problem of a wedge loaded by a concentrated tensile force is analysed.},

  abstract = {In order to optimally design materials, it is crucial to understand the structure-property relations in the material by analyzing the effect of microstructure parameters on the macroscopic properties. In computational homogenization, the microstructure is thus explicitly modeled inside the macrostructure, leading to a coupled two-scale formulation. Unfortunately, the high computational costs of such multiscale simulations often render the solution of design, optimization, or inverse problems infeasible. To address this issue, we propose in this work a non-intrusive reduced basis method to construct inexpensive surrogates for parametrized microscale problems; the method is specifically well-suited for multiscale simulations since the coupled simulation is decoupled into two independent problems: (1) solving the microscopic problem for different (loading or material) parameters and learning a surrogate model from the data; and (2) solving the macroscopic problem with the learned material model. The proposed method has three key features. First, the microscopic stress field can be fully recovered, which is useful for instance for revealing local stress concentrations inside the microstructure. Second, the method is able to accurately predict the stress field for a wide range of material parameters; furthermore, the derivatives of the effective stress with respect to the material parameters are available and can be readily utilized in solving optimization problems. Finally, it is more data efficient, i.e. requiring less training data, as compared to directly performing a regression on the effective stress. To construct the surrogate model, first, a proper orthogonal decomposition is performed on precomputed microscopic stress field snapshots to find a reduced basis for the stress. Second, a regression is employed to infer the coefficients of the reduced basis approximation for any arbitrary parameter value, thus enabling a rapid online evaluation of the microscopic stress. Equipped with the stress field, the effective stress and its partial derivatives can then be derived analytically. For the microstructures in the two test problems considered, the mean approximation error of the effective stress is as low as 0.1\% despite using a relatively small training dataset. Embedded into the macroscopic problem, the reduced order model leads to an online computational speed up of approximately three orders of magnitude while maintaining a high accuracy as compared to the FE2 solver.},

  abstract = {Highly accurate numerical or physical experiments are often very time-consuming or expensive to obtain. When time or budget restrictions prohibit the generation of additional data, the amount of available samples may be too limited to provide satisfactory model results. Multi-fidelity methods deal with such problems by incorporating information from other sources, which are ideally well-correlated with the high-fidelity data, but can be obtained at a lower cost. By leveraging correlations between different data sets, multi-fidelity methods often yield superior generalization when compared to models based solely on a small amount of high-fidelity data. In the current work, we present the use of artificial neural networks applied to multifidelity regression problems. By elaborating a few existing approaches, we propose new neural network architectures for multi-fidelity regression. The introduced models are compared against a traditional multifidelity regression scheme \textendash{} co-kriging. A collection of artificial benchmarks are presented to measure the performance of the analyzed models. The results show that cross-validation in combination with Bayesian optimization consistently leads to neural network models that outperform the co-kriging scheme. Additionally, we show an application of multi-fidelity regression to an engineering problem. The propagation of a pressure wave into an acoustic horn with parametrized shape and frequency is considered, and the index of reflection intensity is approximated using the proposed multi-fidelity models. A finite element, full-order model and a reduced-order model built through the reduced basis method are adopted as the high- and low-fidelity, respectively. It is shown that the multi-fidelity neural network returns outputs that achieve a comparable accuracy to those from the expensive, full-order model, using only very few full-order evaluations combined with a larger amount of inaccurate but cheap evaluations of a reduced order model.},

While common PINN algorithms are based on training one deep neural network (DNN), we propose a multi-network model that results in more accurate representation of the field variables. To validate the model, we test the framework on synthetic data generated from analytical and numerical reference solutions. We study convergence of the PINN model, and show that Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) results in superior accuracy and convergence characteristics compared with classic low-order Finite Element Method (FEM). We also show the applicability of the framework for transfer learning, and find vastly accelerated convergence during network re-training. Finally, we find that honoring the physics leads to improved robustness: when trained only on a few parameters, we find that the PINN model can accurately predict the solution for a wide range of parameters new to the network\textemdash thus pointing to an important application of this framework to sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling.},

  abstract = {Gaussian Process (GP) regression has seen widespread use in robotics due to its generality, simplicity of use, and the utility of Bayesian predictions. The predominant implementation of GP regression is a nonparameteric kernel-based approach, as it enables fitting of arbitrary nonlinear functions. However, this approach suffers from two main drawbacks: (1) it is computationally inefficient, as computation scales poorly with the number of samples; and (2) it can be data inefficient, as encoding prior knowledge that can aid the model through the choice of kernel and associated hyperparameters is often challenging and unintuitive. In this work, we propose ALPaCA, an algorithm for efficient Bayesian regression which addresses these issues. ALPaCA uses a dataset of sample functions to learn a domain-specific, finite-dimensional feature encoding, as well as a prior over the associated weights, such that Bayesian linear regression in this feature space yields accurate online predictions of the posterior predictive density. These features are neural networks, which are trained via a meta-learning (or ``learning-to-learn'') approach. ALPaCA extracts all prior information directly from the dataset, rather than restricting prior information to the choice of kernel hyperparameters. Furthermore, by operating in the weight space, it substantially reduces sample complexity. We investigate the performance of ALPaCA on two simple regression problems, two simulated robotic systems, and on a lane-change driving task performed by humans. We find our approach outperforms kernel-based GP regression, as well as state of the art meta-learning approaches, thereby providing a promising plug-in tool for many regression tasks in robotics where scalability and data-efficiency are important.},

In this work, we enable the application of generic meta-learning algorithms to settings where this task segmentation is unavailable, such as continual online learning with unsegmented time series data. We present meta-learning via online changepoint analysis (MOCA), an approach which augments a meta-learning algorithm with a differentiable Bayesian changepoint detection scheme. The framework allows both training and testing directly on time series data without segmenting it into discrete tasks. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on three nonlinear meta-regression benchmarks as well as two meta-image-classification benchmarks.},

One particular formalism that studies learning under non-stationary distribution is provided by continual learning, where the non-stationarity is imposed by a sequence of distinct tasks. Most methods in this space assume, however, the knowledge of task boundaries, and focus on alleviating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we depart from this view and move the focus towards faster remembering \textendash{} i.e measuring how quickly the network recovers performance rather than measuring the network's performance without any adaptation. We argue that in many settings this can be more effective and that it opens the door to combining meta-learning and continual learning techniques, leveraging their complementary advantages. We propose a framework specific for the scenario where no information about task boundaries or task identity is given. It relies on a separation of concerns into what task is being solved and how the task should be solved. This framework is implemented by differentiating task specific parameters from task agnostic parameters, where the latter are optimized in a continual meta learning fashion, without access to multiple tasks at the same time. We showcase this framework in a supervised learning scenario and discuss the implications of the proposed formalism.},

The reduction process is divided into two sequential stages. The first stage consists in a common Galerkin projection onto a reduced-order space, as well as in the condensation of boundary conditions and external forces. For the second stage (reduction in number of integration points), we present a novel cubature scheme that efficiently determines optimal points and associated positive weights so that the error in integrating reduced internal forces is minimized. The distinguishing features of the proposed method are: (1) The minimization problem is posed in terms of orthogonal basis vector (obtained via a partitioned Singular Value Decomposition) rather that in terms of snapshots of the integrand. (2) The volume of the domain is exactly integrated. (3) The selection algorithm need not solve in all iterations a nonnegative least-squares problem to force the positiveness of the weights. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method converges to the absolute minimum (zero integration error) when the number of selected points is equal to the number of internal force modes included in the objective function. We illustrate this model reduction methodology by two nonlinear, structural examples (quasi-static bending and resonant vibration of elastoplastic composite plates). In both examples, the number of integration points is reduced three order of magnitudes (with respect to FE analyses) without significantly sacrificing accuracy.},

These advanced composite materials were reinforced by organic and/or inorganic fibers and formulated using various fillers such as organic, mineral and metallic. Further, we present the development and the synthesis of several macromolecular matrices namely polycarbonate, polyhexamethylene sebacic, polyether sulfone, polyether ether ketone, polyether ketone ketone, polyether imide, polyethylene terephthalate, phenoplasts, epoxy resin and polyurethane. The advantage of composite materials formulating is to have excellent mechanical performances, high thermal resistance, good fire behavior, high impact resistance, best abrasion resistance, exceptional electric insulation and good rigidity. Then, composite materials formulation were examined and discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {Despite increasing focus on data publication and discovery in materials science and related fields, the global view of materials data is highly sparse. This sparsity encourages training models on the union of multiple datasets, but simple unions can prove problematic as (ostensibly) equivalent properties may be measured or computed differently depending on the data source. These hidden contextual differences introduce irreducible errors into analyses, fundamentally limiting their accuracy. Transfer learning, where information from one dataset is used to inform a model on another, can be an effective tool for bridging sparse data while preserving the contextual differences in the underlying measurements. Here, we describe and compare three techniques for transfer learning: multi-task, difference, and explicit latent variable architectures. We show that difference architectures are most accurate in the multi-fidelity case of mixed DFT and experimental band gaps, while multi-task most improves classification performance of color with band gaps. For activation energies of steps in NO reduction, the explicit latent variable method is not only the most accurate, but also enjoys cancellation of errors in functions that depend on multiple tasks. These results motivate the publication of high quality materials datasets that encode transferable information, independent of industrial or academic interest in the particular labels, and encourage further development and application of transfer learning methods to materials informatics problems.},

We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function f\texttheta{} (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We prove the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK when the data is supported on the sphere and the non-linearity is non-polynomial.},

In this work, we propose Perceiver IO, a general-purpose architecture that handles data from arbitrary settings while scaling linearly with the size of inputs and outputs. Our model augments the Perceiver with a flexible querying mechanism that enables outputs of various sizes and semantics, doing away with the need for task-specific architecture engineering. The same architecture achieves strong results on tasks spanning natural language and visual understanding, multi-task and multi-modal reasoning, and StarCraft II. As highlights, Perceiver IO outperforms a Transformer-based BERT baseline on the GLUE language benchmark despite removing input tokenization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sintel optical flow estimation with no explicit mechanisms for multiscale correspondence.},

  abstract = {Meta-learning approaches have been proposed to tackle the few-shot learning problem. Typically, a meta-learner is trained on a variety of tasks in the hopes of being generalizable to new tasks. However, the generalizability on new tasks of a meta-learner could be fragile when it is over-trained on existing tasks during meta-training phase. In other words, the initial model of a meta-learner could be too biased towards existing tasks to adapt to new tasks, especially when only very few examples are available to update the model. To avoid a biased meta-learner and improve its generalizability, we propose a novel paradigm of Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (TAML) algorithms. Specifically, we present an entropy-based approach that meta-learns an unbiased initial model with the largest uncertainty over the output labels by preventing it from over-performing in classification tasks. Alternatively, a more general inequality-minimization TAML is presented for more ubiquitous scenarios by directly minimizing the inequality of initial losses beyond the classification tasks wherever a suitable loss can be defined. Experiments on benchmarked datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform compared meta-learning algorithms in both few-shot classification and reinforcement learning tasks.},

  abstract = {This research aims to propose a machine learning (ML)-based constitutive model to predict elastoplastic behavior for J2-plasticity. An artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed to replace the nonlinear stress-integration scheme conducted in the conventional theoretical constitutive model under isotropic hardening and associated flow rule. The training dataset required for the ANN Model was numerically generated based on the conventional return map\- ping scheme in the principal stress space. The training has been effectively carried out with one element simulation along all the possible plastic loading paths for problem independent training. A conventional theoretical method is used for the unloading procedure. Therefore, ANN is selectively utilized only for nonlinear plastic loading while keeping linear elastic loading and the unloading with a physics-based model. After one element training, the ML-based constitutive model was implemented in Abaqus User MATerial (UMAT) and its performance was verified. For this purpose, one element and tensile test simulations were applied to examine the accuracy of the ANN-based model. Also, for fully nonlinear strain-paths, a circular cup drawing simulation was applied to predict the cup profiles which was compared with that to the conventional J2 plas\- ticity. It was concluded that the simulation results predicted from the ANN-based model show good agreement with those from the conventional J2-based constitutive model. Also, according to simulation time, the ANN-based model shows an advantage in computational efficiency.},

However, the convergence of the general multi-step MAML still remains unexplored. In this paper, we develop a new theoretical framework to provide such convergence guarantee for two types of objective functions that are of interest in practice: (a) resampling case (e.g., reinforcement learning), where loss functions take the form in expectation and new data are sampled as the algorithm runs; and (b) finite-sum case (e.g., supervised learning), where loss functions take the finite-sum form with given samples. For both cases, we characterize the convergence rate and the computational complexity to attain an \k{o}-accurate solution for multi-step MAML in the general nonconvex setting. In particular, our results suggest that an inner-stage stepsize needs to be chosen inversely proportional to the number N of inner-stage steps in order for N -step MAML to have guaranteed convergence. From the technical perspective, we develop novel techniques to deal with the nested structure of the meta gradient for multi-step MAML, which can be of independent interest.},

One of the most promising signals is the non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. However, due to the non-stationary nature of EEGs, a subject's signal may change over time, which poses a challenge for models that work across time. Recently, domain adaptive learning (DAL) has shown its superior performance in various classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a regularized reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) subspace learning algorithm with K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) as a classifier for the task of motion imagery signal classification. First, we reformulate the framework of RKHS subspace learning with a rigorous mathematical inference. Secondly, since the commonly used maximum mean difference (MMD) criterion measures the distribution variance based on the mean value only and ignores the local information of the distribution, a regularization term of source domain linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) is proposed for the first time, which reduces the variance of similar data and increases the variance of dissimilar data to optimize the distribution of source domain data. Finally, the RKHS subspace framework was constructed sparsely considering the sensitivity of the BCI data. We test the proposed algorithm in this paper, first on four standard datasets, and the experimental results show that the other baseline algorithms improve the average accuracy by 2\textendash 9\% after adding SLDA. In the motion imagery classification experiments, the average accuracy of our algorithm is 3\% higher than the other algorithms, demonstrating the adaptability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Meta-learning automatically infers an inductive bias by observing data from a number of related tasks. The inductive bias is encoded by hyperparameters that determine aspects of the model class or training algorithm, such as initialization or learning rate. Meta-learning assumes that the learning tasks belong to a task environment, and that tasks are drawn from the same task environment both during meta-training and meta-testing. This, however, may not hold true in practice. In this paper, we introduce the problem of transfer meta-learning, in which tasks are drawn from a target task environment during meta-testing that may differ from the source task environment observed during meta-training. Novel information-theoretic upper bounds are obtained on the transfer meta-generalization gap, which measures the difference between the meta-training loss, available at the meta-learner, and the average loss on meta-test data from a new, randomly selected, task in the target task environment. The first bound, on the average transfer meta-generalization gap, captures the meta-environment shift between source and target task environments via the KL divergence between source and target data distributions. The second, PAC-Bayesian bound, and the third, single-draw bound, account for this shift via the loglikelihood ratio between source and target task distributions. Furthermore, two transfer meta-learning solutions are introduced. For the first, termed Empirical Meta-Risk Minimization (EMRM), we derive bounds on the average optimality gap. The second, referred to as Information Meta-Risk Minimization (IMRM), is obtained by minimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound. IMRM is shown via experiments to potentially outperform EMRM.},

In this paper we develop a statistical minimax framework to characterize the fundamental limits of transfer learning in the context of regression with linear and one-hidden layer neural network models.

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-t ime domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-b ased regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-d imensional problems.},

Describing this deviation by a statistical distribution with a width \{\textbackslash delta\} we find a critical \{\textbackslash delta\} that equalizes chances of gambler and casino in the case of a simple strategy of the game: the gambler always puts equal bets to the last N numbers. For up-critical \{\textbackslash delta\} the expected return of the roulette becomes positive. We show that the dramatic increase of gambler's chances is a manifestation of bunching of numbers in a non-ideal roulette. We also estimate the critical starting capital needed to ensure the low risk game for an indefinite time.},

Despite its simplicity, the algorithm matches, up to a constant factor, a lower bound on the performance of any such parameter-transfer method under natural task similarity assumptions.

  abstract = {We present a new approach to personalized handwriting recognition. The problem, also known as writer adaptation, consists of converting a generic (user-independent) recognizer into a personalized (user-dependent) one, which has an improved recognition rate for a particular user. The adaptation step usually involves user-specific samples, which leads to the fundamental question of how to fuse this new information with that captured by the generic recognizer. We propose adapting the recognizer by minimizing a regularized risk functional (a modified SVM) where the prior knowledge from the generic recognizer enters through a modified regularization term. The result is a simple personalization framework with very good practical properties. Experiments on a 100 class realworld data set show that the number of errors can be reduced by over 40\% with as few as five user samples per character.},

The proposed method combines efficient gradient-based meta-learning with nonparametric variational inference in a principled probabilistic framework. Unlike previous methods, during fast adaptation, the method is capable of learning complex uncertainty structure beyond a simple Gaussian approximation, and during meta-update, a novel Bayesian mechanism prevents meta-level overfitting. Remaining a gradientbased method, it is also the first Bayesian model-agnostic meta-learning method applicable to various tasks including reinforcement learning. Experiment results show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in sinusoidal regression, image classification, active learning, and reinforcement learning.},

Despite its efficacy and simplicity, the burden of calculating the Hessian matrix with large memory footprints is the critical challenge in large-scale applications. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet straightforward method to reduce the cost by reusing the same gradient in a window of inner steps. We describe the dynamics of the multi-step estimation in the Lagrangian formalism and discuss how to reduce evaluating second-order derivatives estimating the dynamics. To validate our method, we experiment on meta-transfer learning and few-shot learning tasks for multiple settings. The experiment on meta-transfer emphasizes the applicability of training meta-networks, where other approximations are limited. For few-shot learning, we evaluate time and memory complexities compared with popular baselines.

Good-performing algorithms discovered by evolutionary algorithm can be reused on data sets of comparable complexity. Furthermore, these algorithms can be scaled up to model large data sets.

  abstract = {In machine learning, if the training data is an unbiased sample of an underlying distribution, then the learned classification function will make accurate predictions for new samples. However, if the training data is not an unbiased sample, then there will be differences between how the training data is distributed and how the test data is distributed. Standard classifiers cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test phases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these types of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization, and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework. Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will discuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open questions will have to be addressed before transfer learners and domain-adaptive classifiers become practical.},

We propose a generalization of neural networks to learn operators that map between infinite dimensional function spaces. We formulate the approximation of operators by composition of a class of linear integral operators and nonlinear activation functions, so that the composed operator can approximate complex nonlinear operators. We prove a universal approximation theorem for our construction. Furthermore, we introduce four classes of operator parameterizations: graph-based operators, low-rank operators, multipole graph-based operators, and Fourier operators and describe efficient algorithms for computing with each one. The proposed neural operators are resolution-invariant: they share the same network parameters between different discretizations of the underlying function spaces and can be used for zero-shot super-resolution. Learning surrogate maps for the solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a motivating class of examples. Numerical experiments are presented in which the solution operator (mapping initial condition to solution) is learned for Burgers' equation and the Navier-Stokes equation, and in which the coefficient to solution map is learned in the Darcy model of porous medium flow; a variety of linear operators, defined by linear PDEs, are also used to illustrate key ideas. In a variety of settings, the proposed neural networks show superior performance compared to existing machine learning based methodologies applied to these problems, while being several order of magnitude faster than conventional PDE solvers.},

  abstract = {Recent work in scientific machine learning has developed so-called physicsinformed neural network (PINN) models. The typical approach is to incorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss function and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We demonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for relatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical phenomena for even slightly more complex problems. In particular, we analyze several distinct situations of widespread physical interest, including learning differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We provide evidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves PDE-based differential operators, can introduce a number of subtle problems, including making the problem more ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that these possible failure modes are not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN architecture, but that the PINN's setup makes the loss landscape very hard to optimize. We then describe two promising solutions to address these failure modes. The first approach is to use curriculum regularization, where the PINN's loss term starts from a simple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively more complex as the NN gets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem as a sequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the entire space-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to 1-2 orders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular PINN training.},

  abstract = {Generally, data is available abundantly in unlabeled form, and its annotation requires some cost. The labeling, as well as learning cost, can be minimized by learning with the minimum labeled data instances. Active learning (AL), learns from a few labeled data instances with the additional facility of querying the labels of instances from an expert annotator or oracle. The active learner uses an instance selection strategy for selecting those critical query instances, which reduce the generalization error as fast as possible. This process results in a refined training dataset, which helps in minimizing the overall cost. The key to the success of AL is query strategies that select the candidate query instances and help the learner in learning a valid hypothesis. This survey reviews AL query strategies for classification, regression, and clustering under the pool-based AL scenario. The query strategies under classification are further divided into: informative-based, representative-based, informative- and representative-based, and others. Also, more advanced query strategies based on reinforcement learning and deep learning, along with query strategies under the realistic environment setting, are presented. After a rigorous mathematical analysis of AL strategies, this work presents a comparative analysis of these strategies. Finally, implementation guide, applications, and challenges of AL are discussed.},

Clever solutions address this issue by inducing sparsity through low-rank approximations, often based on the Nystrom method. Here, we propose a different method to achieve better scalability and higher accuracy using quantum computing, outperforming classical Bayesian neural networks for large datasets significantly. Unlike other approaches to quantum machine learning, the computationally expensive linear algebra operations are not just replaced with their quantum counterparts. Instead, we start from a recent study that proposed a quantum circuit for implementing quantum Gaussian processes and then we use quantum phase estimation to induce a low-rank approximation analogous to that in classical sparse Gaussian processes. We provide evidence through numerical tests, mathematical error bound estimation, and complexity analysis that the method can address the ``curse of dimensionality,'' where each additional input parameter no longer leads to an exponential growth of the computational cost. This is also demonstrated by applying the algorithm in a practical setting and using it in the data-driven design of a recently proposed metamaterial. The algorithm, however, requires significant quantum computing hardware improvements before quantum advantage can be achieved.},

Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations.

Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language.

  abstract = {In this paper, we show that parameters of a neural network can have redundancy in their ranks, both theoretically and empirically. When viewed as a function from one space to another, neural networks can exhibit feature correlation and slower training due to this redundancy. Motivated by this, we propose a novel regularization method to reduce the redundancy in the rank of parameters. It is a combination of an objective function that makes the parameter rank-deficient and a dynamic low-rank factorization algorithm that gradually reduces the size of this parameter by fusing linearly dependent vectors together. This regularization-by-pruning approach leads to a neural network with better training dynamics and fewer trainable parameters. We also present experimental results that verify our claims. When applied to a neural network trained to classify images, this method provides statistically significant improvement in accuracy and 7.1 times speedup in terms of number of steps required for training. Furthermore, this approach has the side benefit of reducing the network size, which led to a model with 30.65\% fewer trainable parameters.},

For example recognition in sketch images, which are distinctly more abstract and rarer than photos. Nevertheless, DG methods have primarily been evaluated on photo-only benchmarks focusing on alleviating the dataset bias where both problems of domain distinctiveness and data sparsity can be minimal. We argue that these benchmarks are overly straightforward, and show that simple deep learning baselines perform surprisingly well on them.},

However, as the number of tasks grows, storing and retraining on such data becomes infeasible. A new problem arises where we add new capabilities to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but the training data for its existing capabilities are unavailable. We propose our Learning without Forgetting method, which uses only new task data to train the network while preserving the original capabilities. Our method performs favorably compared to commonly used feature extraction and fine-tuning adaption techniques and performs similarly to multitask learning that uses original task data we assume unavailable. A more surprising observation is that Learning without Forgetting may be able to replace fine-tuning with similar old and new task datasets for improved new task performance.},

  abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent with a large initial learning rate is widely used for training modern neural net architectures. Although a small initial learning rate allows for faster training and better test performance initially, the large learning rate achieves better generalization soon after the learning rate is annealed. Towards explaining this phenomenon, we devise a setting in which we can prove that a two layer network trained with large initial learning rate and annealing provably generalizes better than the same network trained with a small learning rate from the start. The key insight in our analysis is that the order of learning different types of patterns is crucial: because the small learning rate model first memorizes easy-to-generalize, hard-to-fit patterns, it generalizes worse on hard-to-generalize, easier-to-fit patterns than its large learning rate counterpart. This concept translates to a larger-scale setting: we demonstrate that one can add a small patch to CIFAR-10 images that is immediately memorizable by a model with small initial learning rate, but ignored by the model with large learning rate until after annealing. Our experiments show that this causes the small learning rate model's accuracy on unmodified images to suffer, as it relies too much on the patch early on.},

A mechanistic, data-driven, two-scale approach is developed for predicting the behavior of general heterogeneous materials under irreversible processes such as inelastic deformation. The proposed approach includes two major innovations: (1) the use of a data compression algorithm, k-means clustering, during the offline stage of the method to homogenize the local features of the material microstructure into a group of clusters; and (2) a new method called self-consistent clustering analysis used in the online stage that is valid for any local plasticity laws of each material phase without the need for additional calibration. A particularly important feature of the proposed approach is that the offline stage only uses the linear elastic properties of each material phase, making it efficient. This work is believed to open new avenues in parameter-free multi-scale modeling of complex materials, and perhaps in other fields that require homogenization of irreversible processes.},

Importantly, the trained network is valid for any local material laws without the need for additional calibration or micromechanics assumption. Its extrapolations to unknown material and loading spaces for a wide range of problems are validated through numerical experiments, including linear elasticity with high contrast of phase properties, nonlinear history-dependent plasticity and finite-strain hyperelasticity under large deformations.},

Since all the databases share the same base network structure, their fitting parameters can be interpolated to seamlessly create intermediate databases. The new transferred models are shown to outperform the analytical micromechanics methods in predicting the volume fraction effects.

We are interested in the injection-molded short fiber reinforced composites, which have been identified as key material systems in automotive, aerospace, and electronics industries. The molding process induces spatially varying microstructures across various length scales, while the resulting strongly anisotropic and nonlinear material properties are still challenging to be captured by conventional modeling approaches. To prepare the linear elastic training data for our machine learning tasks, Representative Volume Elements (RVE) with different fiber orientations and volume fractions are generated through stochastic reconstruction. More importantly, we utilize the recently proposed Deep Material Network (DMN) to learn the hidden microscale morphologies from data. With essential physics embedded in its building blocks, this data-driven material model can be extrapolated to predict nonlinear material behaviors efficiently and accurately. Through the transfer learning of DMN, we create a unified process-guided material database that covers a full range of geometric descriptors for short fiber reinforced composites. Finally, this unified DMN database is implemented and coupled with macroscale finite element model to enable concurrent multiscale simulations. From our perspective, the proposed framework is also promising in many other emergent multiscale engineering systems, such as additive manufacturing and compressive molding.},

First, we aim to understand more about when and why fine-tuning and joint training can be suboptimal or even harmful for transfer learning. We design semi-synthetic datasets where the source task can be solved by either source-specific features or transferable features. We observe that (1) pre-training may not have incentive to learn transferable features and (2) joint training may simultaneously learn source-specific features and overfit to the target. Second, to improve over fine-tuning and joint training, we propose Meta Representation Learning (MeRLin) to learn transferable features. MeRLin meta-learns representations by ensuring that a head fit on top of the representations with target training data also performs well on target validation data. We also prove that MeRLin recovers the target ground-truth model with a quadratic neural net parameterization and a source distribution that contains both transferable and source-specific features. On the same distribution, pre-training and joint training provably fail to learn transferable features. MeRLin empirically outperforms previous state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms on various real-world vision and NLP transfer learning benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Significance             Data-driven approaches have launched a new paradigm in scientific research that is bound to have an impact on all disciplines of science and engineering. However, at this juncture, the exploration of data-driven techniques in the century-old field of fracture mechanics is highly limited, and there are key challenges including accurate and intelligent knowledge extraction and transfer in a data-limited regime. Here, we propose a framework for data-driven knowledge extraction in fracture mechanics with rigorous accuracy assessment which employs active learning for optimizing data usage and for data-driven knowledge transfer that allows efficient treatment of three-dimensional fracture problems based on two-dimensional solutions.           ,              Data-driven approaches promise to usher in a new phase of development in fracture mechanics, but very little is currently known about how data-driven knowledge extraction and transfer can be accomplished in this field. As in many other fields, data scarcity presents a major challenge for knowledge extraction, and knowledge transfer among different fracture problems remains largely unexplored. Here, a data-driven framework for knowledge extraction with rigorous metrics for accuracy assessments is proposed and demonstrated through a nontrivial linear elastic fracture mechanics problem encountered in small-scale toughness measurements. It is shown that a tailored active learning method enables accurate knowledge extraction even in a data-limited regime. The viability of knowledge transfer is demonstrated through mining the hidden connection between the selected three-dimensional benchmark problem and a well-established auxiliary two-dimensional problem. The combination of data-driven knowledge extraction and transfer is expected to have transformative impact in this field over the coming decades.},

However, most prior methods have not simultaneously reduced the difference in both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution between domains. In this paper, we put forward a novel transfer learning approach, referred to as Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA). Specifically, JDA aims to jointly adapt both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is effective and robust for substantial distribution difference. Extensive experiments verify that JDA can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art methods on four types of cross-domain image classification problems.},

Studying such curves on one or more data sets is a way to get to a better understanding of the generalization properties of this learner. The behavior of learning curves is, however, not very well understood and can display (for most researchers) quite unexpected behavior. Our work introduces the formal notion of risk monotonicity, which asks the risk to not deteriorate with increasing training set sizes in expectation over the training samples. We then present the surprising result that various standard learners, specifically those that minimize the empirical risk, can act nonmonotonically irrespective of the training sample size. We provide a theoretical underpinning for specific instantiations from classification, regression, and density estimation. Altogether, the proposed monotonicity notion opens up a whole new direction of research.},

Whether or not this phenomenon, which we term dipping, can be observed depends on the choice of classifier in relation to the underlying class distributions. We give some simple examples, for a few classifiers, that illustrate how the dipping phenomenon can occur. Additionally, we speculate about what generally is needed for dipping to emerge. What is clear is that this kind of learning curve behavior does not emerge due to mere chance and that the pattern recognition practitioner ought to take note of it.},

We argue, moreover, that we may expect these solutions to really improve upon the supervised classifier in particular cases. In a worked-out example for LDA, we take it one step further and essentially prove that its semi-supervised version is strictly better than its supervised counterpart. The two new concepts that form the core of our estimation principle are contrast and pessimism. The former refers to the fact that our objective function takes the supervised estimates into account, enabling the semi-supervised solution to explicitly control the potential improvements over this estimate. The latter refers to the fact that our estimates are conservative and therefore resilient to whatever form the true labeling of the unlabeled data takes on. Experiments demonstrate the improvements in terms of both the log-likelihood and the classification error rate on independent test sets.},

Classifiers are the tools that implement the actual functional mapping from these measurements\textemdash also called features or inputs\textemdash to the so-called class label\textemdash or output. The fields of pattern recognition and machine learning study ways of constructing such classifiers. The main idea behind supervised methods is that of learning from examples: given a number of example input-output relations, to what extent can the general mapping be learned that takes any new and unseen feature vector to its correct class? This chapter provides a basic introduction to the underlying ideas of how to come to a supervised classification problem. In addition, it provides an overview of some specific classification techniques, delves into the issues of object representation and classifier evaluation, and (very) briefly covers some variations on the basic supervised classification task that may also be of interest to the practitioner.},

Then, a FE2 method replacing the nonlinear multiscale calculations by the NN\textendash I is developed. The NN\textendash I scheme improved the accuracy of the neural-network surrogate model when insufficient data were available. Due to the achieved reduction in computational time, which was several orders of magnitude less than that to direct FE2, the use of such a machine-learning method is demonstrated for performing Monte Carlo simulations in nonlinear heterogeneous structures and propagating uncertainties in this context, and the identification of probabilistic models at the macroscale on some quantities of interest.

  abstract = {While it is widely known that neural networks are universal approximators of continuous functions, a less known and perhaps more powerful result is that a neural network with a single hidden layer can approximate accurately any nonlinear continuous operator [5]. This universal approximation theorem is suggestive of the potential application of neural networks in learning nonlinear operators from data. However, the theorem guarantees only a small approximation error for a sufficient large network, and does not consider the important optimization and generalization errors. To realize this theorem in practice, we propose deep operator networks (DeepONets) to learn operators accurately and efficiently from a relatively small dataset. A DeepONet consists of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of sensors xi, i = 1, . . . , m (branch net), and another for encoding the locations for the output functions (trunk net). We perform systematic simulations for identifying two types of operators, i.e., dynamic systems and partial differential equations, and demonstrate that DeepONet significantly reduces the generalization error compared to the fully-connected networks. We also derive theoretically the dependence of the approximation error in terms of the number of sensors (where the input function is defined) as well as the input function type, and we verify the theorem with computational results. More importantly, we observe high-order error convergence in our computational tests, namely polynomial rates (from half order to fourth order) and even exponential convergence with respect to the training dataset size.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. A key in this campaign consists in reducing the domain shift, i.e., enforcing the data distributions of the two domains to be similar. One of the common strategies is to align the marginal distribution in the feature space through adversarial learning. However, this global alignment strategy does not consider the category-level joint distribution. A possible consequence of such global movement is that some categories which are originally well aligned between the source and target may be incorrectly mapped, thus leading to worse segmentation results in target domain. To address this problem, we introduce a category-level adversarial network, aiming to enforce local semantic consistency during the trend of global alignment. Our idea is to take a close look at the category-level joint distribution and align each class with an adaptive adversarial loss. Specifically, we reduce the weight of the adversarial loss for category-level aligned features while increasing the adversarial force for those poorly aligned. In this process, we decide how well a feature is category-level aligned between source and target by a co-training approach. In two domain adaptation tasks, i.e., GTA5 \textrightarrow{} Cityscapes and SYNTHIA \textrightarrow{} Cityscapes, we validate that the proposed method matches the state of the art in segmentation accuracy.},

We show that the DNN predicts the local stresses with 3.8\% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the case of heterogeneous elastic media and a mechanical contrast of up to factor of 1.5 among neighboring domains, while performing 103 times faster than spectral solvers. The DNN model proves suited for reproducing the stress distribution in geometries different from those used for training. In the case of elasto-plastic materials with up to 4 times mechanical contrast in yield stress among adjacent regions, the trained model simulates the micromechanics with a MAPE of 6.4\% in one single forward evaluation of the network, without any iteration. The results reveal an efficient approach to solve non-linear mechanical problems, with an acceleration up to a factor of 8300 for elastic-plastic materials compared to typical solvers.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a framework for the treatment of a homogenized macro-continuum with locally attached micro-structure, which undergoes non-isothermal inelastic deformations at large strains. The proposed concept is applied to the simulation of texture evolution in polycrystalline metals, where the micro-structure consists of a representative assembly of single crystal grains. The deformation of this micro-structure is coupled with the local deformation at a typical material point of the macro-continuum by three alternative constraints of the microscopic fluctuation field. In a deformation driven process, extensive macroscopic variables, like stresses and dissipation are defined as volume averages of their microscopic counterparts in an accompanying local equilibrium state of the micro-structure. The proposed numerical implementation is based in the general setting on a finite element discretization of the macro-continuum which is locally coupled at each Gauss point with a finite element discretization of the attached micro-:\textasciitilde tructure. In the first part of the paper we set up the two coupled boundary value problems associated with the macro-continuum and the pointwise attached micro-structure and consider aspects of their finite element solutions. The second part presents details of a robust algorithmic model of finite plasticity for single crystals which governs the response of the grains in a typical micro-structure. The paper concludes with some representative numerical examples by demonstrating the performance of the proposed concept with regard to the prediction of texture evolution in polycrystals. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

In response, recent work in meta-learning proposes training a meta-learner on a distribution of similar tasks, in the hopes of generalization to novel but related tasks by learning a high-level strategy that captures the essence of the problem it is asked to solve. However, many recent meta-learning approaches are extensively hand-designed, either using architectures specialized to a particular application, or hard-coding algorithmic components that constrain how the meta-learner solves the task. We propose a class of simple and generic meta-learner architectures that use a novel combination of temporal convolutions and soft attention; the former to aggregate information from past experience and the latter to pinpoint specific pieces of information. In the most extensive set of meta-learning experiments to date, we evaluate the resulting Simple Neural AttentIve Learner (or SNAIL) on several heavily-benchmarked tasks. On all tasks, in both supervised and reinforcement learning, SNAIL attains state-of-the-art performance by significant margins.},

  abstract = {Significance             We show that material plasticity can be precisely and efficiently predicted by deep-learning methods. This approach is fundamentally different from the century-old theory of continuum plasticity because it is not iteratively tracing the yield surface, neither does it require the notion of effective strain or stress at the macroscopic level. Instead, we use representative computer simulations of materials, including microstructure and constituents, load them along different deformation paths, and then learn the reversible, irreversible, and history-dependent phenomena directly from data. We demonstrate that complex phenomena such as distortional hardening can be predicted within 0.5\% error. The generality of the methodology and widespread importance of plasticity in designing structures and materials make it useful to a myriad of fields.           ,              Plasticity theory aims at describing the yield loci and work hardening of a material under general deformation states. Most of its complexity arises from the nontrivial dependence of the yield loci on the complete strain history of a material and its microstructure. This motivated 3 ingenious simplifications that underpinned a century of developments in this field: 1) yield criteria describing yield loci location; 2) associative or nonassociative flow rules defining the direction of plastic flow; and 3) effective stress\textendash strain laws consistent with the plastic work equivalence principle. However, 2 key complications arise from these simplifications. First, finding equations that describe these 3 assumptions for materials with complex microstructures is not trivial. Second, yield surface evolution needs to be traced iteratively, i.e., through a return mapping algorithm. Here, we show that these assumptions are not needed in the context of sequence learning when using recurrent neural networks, diverting the above-mentioned complications. This work offers an alternative to currently established plasticity formulations by providing the foundations for finding history- and microstructure-dependent constitutive models through deep learning.},

This striking phenomenon, often referred to as ``double descent'', has raised questions of if we need to re-think our current understanding of generalization. In this work, we study whether the double-descent phenomenon can be avoided by using optimal regularization. Theoretically, we prove that for certain linear regression models with isotropic data distribution, optimally-tuned 2 regularization achieves monotonic test performance as we grow either the sample size or the model size. We also demonstrate empirically that optimally-tuned 2 regularization can mitigate double descent for more general models, including neural networks. Our results suggest that it may also be informative to study the test risk scalings of various algorithms in the context of appropriately tuned regularization.},

Although Kriging offers a solution to this problem, it requires the prior specification of a kernel and it is not scalable to large datasets. We explore a numerical approximation approach to kernel selection/construction based on the simple premise that a kernel must be good if the number of interpolation points can be halved without significant loss in accuracy (measured using the intrinsic RKHS norm {$\cdot$} associated with the kernel). We first test and motivate this idea on a simple problem of recovering the Green's function of an elliptic PDE (with inhomogeneous coefficients) from the sparse observation of one of its solutions. Next we consider the problem of learning non-parametric families of deep kernels of the form K1(Fn(x), Fn(x )) with Fn+1 = (Id + Gn+1) {$\smwhtcircle$} Fn and Gn+1 {$\in$} span\{K1(Fn(xi), {$\cdot$})\}. With the proposed approach constructing the kernel becomes equivalent to integrating a stochastic data driven dynamical system, which allows for the training of very deep (bottomless) networks and the exploration of their properties. These networks learn by constructing flow maps in the kernel and input spaces via incremental data-dependent deformations/perturbations (appearing as the cooperative counterpart of adversarial examples) and, at profound depths, they (1) can achieve accurate classification from only one data point per class (2) appear to learn archetypes of each class (3) expand distances between points that are in different classes and contract distances between points in the same class. For kernels parameterized by the weights of Convolutional Neural Networks, minimizing approximation errors incurred by halving random subsets of interpolation points, appears to outperform training (the same CNN architecture) with relative entropy and dropout.},

  abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

Supervised learning of center locations in some applications show that they are superior to the networks whose centers are located using unsupervised methods. But such networks can take the same training time as that of sigmoid networks. Supervised learning of centers seem to offset the advantages acheived by the two stage learning of the RBF networks. One way to overcome this may be to train the network with a set of centers selected by unsupervised methods and then to fine tune the centers. Tliis can be done by first evaluating whether moving the centers would decrease the error and depending on the needed level of accuracy position of the centers can be changed. In this paper we have calculated bounds for the gradient and hessian of the error considered as a function of centers for networks of fixed size. Using these bounds it will be possible to know by how much one can reduce the error by changing the centers. Further, step size can be specified to acheive a guaranteed amount of reduction in error.},

This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-theart deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.},

Requiring a large number of data samples, many deep learning solutions suffer from data hunger and extensively high computation time and resources. Furthermore, data is often not available due to not only the nature of the problem or privacy concerns but also the cost of data preparation. Data collection, preprocessing, and labeling are strenuous human tasks. Therefore, few-shot learning that could drastically reduce the turnaround time of building machine learning applications emerges as a low-cost solution. This survey paper comprises a representative list of recently1 proposed few-shot learning algorithms.

Unlike deep learning, meta-learning can be applied to few-shot high-dimensional datasets and considers further improving model generalization to unseen tasks. Deep learning is focused upon in-sample prediction and meta-learning concerns model adaptation for out-of-sample prediction. Meta-learning can continually perform self-improvement to achieve highly autonomous AI. Meta-learning may serve as an additional generalization block complementary for original deep learning model. Meta-learning seeks adaptation of machine learning models to unseen tasks which are vastly different from trained tasks. Meta-learning with coevolution between agent and environment provides solutions for complex tasks unsolvable by training from scratch. Meta-learning methodology covers a wide range of great minds and thoughts. We briefly introduce meta-learning methodologies in the following categories: black-box meta-learning, metric-based meta-learning, layered meta-learning and Bayesian meta-learning framework. Recent applications concentrate upon the integration of meta-learning with other machine learning framework to provide feasible integrated problem solutions.

This is particularly effective when the low- and high-fidelity models exhibit strong correlations, and can lead to significant computational gains over approaches that solely rely on high-fidelity models. However, in many cases of practical interest, low-fidelity models can only be well correlated to their high-fidelity counterparts for a specific range of input parameters, and potentially return wrong trends and erroneous predictions if probed outside of their validity regime. Here we put forth a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian process regression and nonlinear autoregressive schemes that is capable of learning complex nonlinear and space-dependent cross-correlations between models of variable fidelity, and can effectively safeguard against low-fidelity models that provide wrong trends. This introduces a new class of multi-fidelity information fusion algorithms that provide a fundamental extension to the existing linear autoregressive methodologies, while still maintaining the same algorithmic complexity and overall computational cost. The performance of the proposed methods is tested in several benchmark problems involving both synthetic and real multi-fidelity datasets from computational fluid dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {This work proposes a Bayesian framework for determining the mechanical properties of carbon based nanocomposites. In particular, Bayesian parameter inference is applied to learn the parameters that characterize the CNT/polymer interface in the microscale. These parameters are associated with great uncertainties and their characterization is a difficult task, since microscale measurements are costly and hard to obtain. To overcome this, the present study introduces a computational framework for updating the prior beliefs on the values of these parameters, by using measurements on large-scale structures comprised of the composite. In terms of modeling, the CNT/polymer interface is formulated with the cohesive zone model and a bilinear bond-slip constitutive law. Typically, predicting the response of such systems requires multiscale analysis approaches, such as the F E2 method, employed in this work. Despite its accuracy, F E2 is associated with immense computational demands for large-scale problems and, therefore, its application to the Bayesian setting, which requires multiple model evaluations, is prohibitive. To alleviate this cost, a surrogate modeling technique is developed which utilizes artificial neural networks, trained to predict the nonlinear stress\textendash strain relationship of representative volume elements of the microstructure. The data set over which the neural network is trained, is obtained by analyzing a limited number of different RVE configurations using a detailed finite element analysis. The elaborated methodology is first validated through a numerical example from 2D elasticity, which demonstrated its high accuracy and its significant cost reduction capabilities. It is then applied to a more challenging large-scale problem from 3D elasticity. Even though this paper focuses on the characterization of the mechanical properties of composite materials, the proposed numerical procedure is generic and can be straightforwardly applied to other physically analogous phenomena related to nano-composite modeling, such as parameter identification in heat transfer or electrical conduction.},

Here, we present general, in-depth, and empirical insights into theory-training networks for learning the solution of highly coupled differential equations. We analyze the deteriorating effects of the oscillating loss on the ability of a network to satisfy the equations at the training data points, measured by the final training loss, and on the accuracy of the inferred solution. We introduce a theory-training technique that, by leveraging regularization, eliminates those oscillations, decreases the final training loss, and improves the accuracy of the inferred solution, with no additional computational cost. Then, we present guidelines that allow a systematic search for the network that has the optimal training time and inference accuracy for a given set of equations; following these guidelines can reduce the number of tedious training iterations in that search. Finally, a comparison between theory-training and the rival, conventional method of solving differential equations using discretization attests to the advantages of theory-training not being necessarily limited to high-dimensional sets of equations. The comparison also reveals a limitation of the current theory-training framework that may limit its application in domains where extreme accuracies are necessary.},

An especially successful algorithm has been Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), a method that consists of two optimization loops, with the outer loop finding a meta-initialization, from which the inner loop can efficiently learn new tasks. Despite MAML's popularity, a fundamental open question remains \textendash{} is the effectiveness of MAML due to the meta-initialization being primed for rapid learning (large, efficient changes in the representations) or due to feature reuse, with the meta-initialization already containing high quality features? We investigate this question, via ablation studies and analysis of the latent representations, finding that feature reuse is the dominant factor. This leads to the ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) algorithm, a simplification of MAML where we remove the inner loop for all but the (task-specific) head of the underlying neural network. ANIL matches MAML's performance on benchmark few-shot image classification and RL and offers computational improvements over MAML. We further study the precise contributions of the head and body of the network, showing that performance on the test tasks is entirely determined by the quality of the learned features, and we can remove even the head of the network (the NIL algorithm). We conclude with a discussion of the rapid learning vs feature reuse question for meta-learning algorithms more broadly.},

  abstract = {Humans can continuously learn new knowledge as their experience grows. In contrast, previous learning in deep neural networks can quickly fade out when they are trained on a new task. In this paper, we hypothesize this problem can be avoided by learning a set of generalized parameters, that are neither specific to old nor new tasks. In this pursuit, we introduce a novel meta-learning approach that seeks to maintain an equilibrium between all the encountered tasks. This is ensured by a new meta-update rule which avoids catastrophic forgetting. In comparison to previous metalearning techniques, our approach is task-agnostic. When presented with a continuum of data, our model automatically identifies the task and quickly adapts to it with just a single update. We perform extensive experiments on five datasets in a class-incremental setting, leading to significant improvements over the state of the art methods (e.g., a 21.3\% boost on CIFAR100 with 10 incremental tasks). Specifically, on large-scale datasets that generally prove difficult cases for incremental learning, our approach delivers absolute gains as high as 19.1\% and 7.4\% on ImageNet and MS-Celeb datasets, respectively.

  abstract = {Though deep neural networks have shown great success in the large data domain, they generally perform poorly on few-shot learning tasks, where a classifier has to quickly generalize after seeing very few examples from each class. The general belief is that gradient-based optimization in high capacity classifiers requires many iterative steps over many examples to perform well. Here, we propose an LSTMbased meta-learner model to learn the exact optimization algorithm used to train another learner neural network classifier in the few-shot regime. The parametrization of our model allows it to learn appropriate parameter updates specifically for the scenario where a set amount of updates will be made, while also learning a general initialization of the learner (classifier) network that allows for quick convergence of training. We demonstrate that this meta-learning model is competitive with deep metric-learning techniques for few-shot learning.},

In order to remedy this situation, I studied practical applications of ML and developed a proposal for a seven-step process that can guide practical applications of ML in engineering. The process is illustrated by relevant applications of ML in civil engineering. This illustration shows that the potential of ML has only begun to be explored but also cautions that in order to be successful, the application process must carefully address the issues related to the seven-step process.},

  abstract = {Although being a popular approach for the modeling of laminated composites, mesoscale constitutive models often struggle to represent material response for arbitrary load cases. A better alternative in terms of accuracy is to use the FE2 technique to upscale microscopic material behavior without loss of generality, but the associated computational effort can be extreme. It is therefore interesting to explore alternative surrogate modeling stra\- tegies that maintain as much of the fidelity of FE2 as possible while still being computationally efficient. In this work, three surrogate modeling approaches are compared in terms of accuracy, efficiency and calibration effort: the state-of-the-art mesoscopic plasticity model by Vogler et al. (Vogler et al., 2013), regularized feed-forward neural networks and hyper-reduced-order models obtained by combining the Proper Orthogonal Decomposi\- tion (POD) and Empirical Cubature Method (ECM) techniques. Training datasets are obtained from a Repre\- sentative Volume Element (RVE) model of the composite microstructure with a number of randomly-distributed linear-elastic fibers surrounded by a matrix with pressure-dependent plasticity. The approaches are evaluated with a comprehensive set of numerical tests comprising pure stress cases and three different stress combinations relevant in the design of laminated composites. The models are assessed on their ability to accurately reproduce the training cases as well as on how well they are able to predict unseen stress combinations. Gains in execution time are compared by using the trained surrogates in the FE2 model of an interlaminar shear test.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Addressing these shortcomings, we introduce a novel meta-learning framework, called F-PACOH, that treats meta-learned priors as stochastic processes and performs meta-level regularization directly in the function space. This allows us to directly steer the probabilistic predictions of the meta-learner towards high epistemic uncertainty in regions of insufficient meta-training data and, thus, obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Finally, we showcase how our approach can be integrated with sequential decision making, where reliable uncertainty quantification is imperative. In our benchmark study on meta-learning for Bayesian Optimization (BO), F-PACOH significantly outperforms all other meta-learners and standard baselines.},

Using these bounds, we develop a class of PAC-optimal meta-learning algorithms with performance guarantees and a principled meta-level regularization.

When instantiating our PACoptimal hyper-posterior (PACOH) with Gaussian processes and Bayesian Neural Networks as base learners, the resulting methods yield state-ofthe-art performance, both in terms of predictive accuracy and the quality of uncertainty estimates.

The underlying assumption of computational homogenization is separation of length scales, and hence, computing the material response at the macroscopic scale from averaging the microscopic behavior. In doing so, the energetic equivalence between the two scales, the Hill\textendash Mandel condition, is guaranteed via imposing proper boundary conditions such as linear displacement, periodic displacement and antiperiodic traction, and constant traction boundary conditions. Focus is given on the finite element implementation of these boundary conditions and their influence on the overall response of the material. Computational frameworks for all canonical boundary conditions are briefly formulated in order to demonstrate similarities and differences among the various boundary conditions. Furthermore, we detail on the computational aspects of the classical Reuss' and Voigt's bounds and their extensions to finite strains. A concise and clear formulation for computing the macroscopic tangent necessary for FE2 calculations is presented. The performances of the proposed schemes are illustrated via a series of two- and three-dimensional numerical examples. The numerical examples provide enough details to serve as benchmarks.},

Current methods generate these mappings from interpolation using a few sparse data points recorded inside the atria; they neither include prior knowledge of the underlying physics nor uncertainty of these recordings. Here we propose a physics-informed neural network for cardiac activation mapping that accounts for the underlying wave propagation dynamics and we quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with these predictions. These uncertainty estimates not only allow us to quantify the predictive error of the neural network, but also help to reduce it by judiciously selecting new informative measurement locations via active learning. We illustrate the potential of our approach using a synthetic benchmark problem and a personalized electrophysiology model of the left atrium. We show that our new method outperforms linear interpolation and Gaussian process regression for the benchmark problem and linear interpolation at clinical densities for the left atrium. In both cases, the active learning algorithm achieves lower error levels than random allocation. Our findings open the door toward physics-based electro-anatomic mapping with the ultimate goals to reduce procedural time and improve diagnostic predictability for patients affected by atrial fibrillation.

Architectures with augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples.

Our learner leads a single life during which actions are continually executed according to the system's internal state and current policy (a modi able, probabilistic algorithm mapping environmental inputs and internal states to outputs and new internal states). An action is considered a learning algorithm if it can modify the policy. E ects of learning processes on later learning processes are measured using reward/time ratios. Occasional backtracking enforces success histories of still valid policy modi cations corresponding to histories of lifelong reward accelerations. The principle allows for plugging in a wide variety of learning algorithms. In particular, it allows for embedding the learner's policy modi cation strategy within the policy itself (self-reference). To demonstrate the principle's feasibility in cases where conventional reinforcement learning fails, we test it in complex, non-Markovian, changing environments (\textbackslash POMDPs"). One of the tasks involves more than 1013 states, two learners that both cooperate and compete, and strongly delayed reinforcement signals (initially separated by more than 300,000 time steps).},

  abstract = {Two adaptive numerical modelling techniques have been applied to prediction of fatigue thresholds in Ni-base superalloys. A Bayesian neural network and a neurofuzzy network have been compared, both of which have the ability to automatically adjust the network's complexity to the current dataset. In both cases, despite inevitable data restrictions, threshold values have been modelled with some degree of success. However, it is argued in this paper that the neurofuzzy modelling approach offers real benefits over the use of a classical neural network as the mathematical complexity of the relationships can be restricted to allow for the paucity of data, and the linguistic fuzzy rules produced allow assessment of the model without extensive interrogation and examination using a hypothetical dataset. The additive neurofuzzy network structure means that redundant inputs can be excluded from the model and simple sub-networks produced which represent global output trends. Both of these aspects are important for final verification and validation of the information extracted from the numerical data. In some situations neurofuzzy networks may require less data to produce a stable solution, and may be easier to verify in the light of existing physical understanding because of the production of transparent linguistic rules. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

  abstract = {Domain adaptation (DA), which leverages labeled data from related source domains, comes in handy when the label information of the target domain is scarce or unavailable. However, as the source data do not come from the same origin as that of the target domain, the predictive distributions of the source and target domains are likely to differ in reality. At the extreme, the predictive distributions of the source domains can differ completely from that of the target domain. In such case, using the learned source classifier to assist in the prediction of target data can result in prediction performance that is poorer than that with the omission of the source data. This phenomenon is established as negative transfer with impact known to be more severe in the multiclass context. To combat negative transfer due to differing predictive distributions across domains, we first introduce the notion of positive transferability for the assessment of synergy between the source and target domains in their prediction models, and we also propose a criterion to measure the positive transferability between sample pairs of different domains in terms of their prediction distributions. With the new measure, a predictive distribution matching (PDM) regularizer and a PDM framework learn the target classifier by favoring source data with large positive transferability while inferring the labels of target unlabeled data. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance efficacy of the proposed PDM framework using several commonly used multidomain benchmark data sets, including Sentiment, Reuters, and Newsgroup, in the context of both binary-class and multiclass domains. Subsequently, the PDM framework is put to work on a real-world scenario pertaining to water cluster molecule identification. The experimental results illustrate the adverse impact of negative transfer on several state-of-the-art DA methods, whereas the proposed framework exhibits excellent and robust predictive performances.},

Current state-ofthe-art methods in this area are fully supervised, but for many real-world problems it is hardly possible to obtain enough labeled samples. In this paper, we propose the first method of domain generalization to leverage unlabeled samples, combining of meta learning's episodic training and semi-supervised learning, called DGSML. DGSML employs an entropy-based pseudo-labeling approach to assign labels to unlabeled samples and then utilizes a novel discrepancy loss to ensure that class centroids before and after labeling unlabeled samples are close to each other. To learn a domain-invariant representation, it also utilizes a novel alignment loss to ensure that the distance between pairs of class centroids, computed after adding the unlabeled samples, is preserved across different domains. DGSML is trained by a meta learning approach to mimic the distribution shift between the input source domains and unseen target domains. Experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate that DGSML outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization and semi-supervised learning methods.},

To learn such weight sets, we adapt the popular MAML algorithm to Fair-MAML by the inclusion of a fairness regularization term. In practice, Fair-MAML allows practitioners to train fair machine learning models from only a few examples when data from related tasks is available. We empirically exhibit the value of this technique by comparing to relevant baselines.},

Then it discusses how to increase/decrease the learning rate/momentum to speed up training. Our experiments show that it is crucial to balance every manner of regularization for each dataset and architecture. Weight decay is used as a sample regularizer to show how its optimal value is tightly coupled with the learning rates and momentum.

It reaches equivalent test accuracies after the same number of training epochs, but with fewer parameter updates, leading to greater parallelism and shorter training times. We can further reduce the number of parameter updates by increasing the learning rate and scaling the batch size B {$\propto$} . Finally, one can increase the momentum coefficient m and scale B {$\propto$} 1/(1 - m), although this tends to slightly reduce the test accuracy. Crucially, our techniques allow us to repurpose existing training schedules for large batch training with no hyper-parameter tuning.

  abstract = {Models like LASSO and ridge regression are extensively used in practice due to their interpretability, ease of use, and strong theoretical guarantees. Crossvalidation (CV) is widely used for hyperparameter tuning in these models, but do practical optimization methods minimize the true out-of-sample loss? A recent line of research promises to show that the optimum of the CV loss matches the optimum of the out-of-sample loss (possibly after simple corrections). It remains to show how tractable it is to minimize the CV loss. In the present paper, we show that, in the case of ridge regression, the CV loss may fail to be quasiconvex and thus may have multiple local optima. We can guarantee that the CV loss is quasiconvex in at least one case: when the spectrum of the covariate matrix is nearly flat and the noise in the observed responses is not too high. More generally, we show that quasiconvexity status is independent of many properties of the observed data (response norm, covariate-matrix right singular vectors, and singular-value scaling) and has a complex dependence on the few that remain. We empirically confirm our theory using simulated experiments.},

  abstract = {Meta-learning has been proposed as a framework to address the challenging few-shot learning setting. The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, meta-learning typically uses shallow neural networks (SNNs), thus limiting its effectiveness. In this paper we propose a novel few-shot learning method called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to adapt a deep NN for few shot learning tasks. Specifically, meta refers to training multiple tasks, and transfer is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum for MTL. We conduct experiments using (5-class, 1-shot) and (5-class, 5shot) recognition tasks on two challenging few-shot learning benchmarks: miniImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our meta-transfer learning approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy1.},

The developed methodology is demonstrated by sample macroscale problems in the context of the multilevel finite element strategy. Due to the high memory allocation costs that the condensation procedure induces, a perturbation procedure is developed based on a minimal number of micromechanical tests. Results from the condensation and perturbation procedures are compared for sample infinitesimal and finite deformation inelasticity problems and the algorithmic consistency of the macroscopic tangent with the evolution of the macroscopic stress is discussed. It is shown that the ability to compute the macroscopic tangent can also be employed to construct a stress controlled micromechanical testing procedure.},

  abstract = {We investigate the use of discrete and continuous versions of physics-informed neural network methods for learning unknown dynamics or constitutive relations of a dynamical system . For the case of unknown dynamics, we represent all the dynamics with a deep neural network (DNN). When the dynamics of the system are known up to the specification of constitutive relations (that can depend on the state of the system), we represent these constitutive relations with a DNN. The discrete versions combine classical multistep discretization methods for dynamical systems with neural network based machine learning methods. On the other hand, the continuous versions utilize deep neural networks to minimize the residual function for the continuous governing equations. We use the case of a fedbatch bioreactor system to study the effectiveness of these approaches and discuss conditions for their applicability. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the trained neural network models is much higher for the cases where we only have to learn a constitutive relation instead of the whole dynamics. This finding corroborates the well-known fact from scientific computing that building as much structural information is available into an algorithm can enhance its efficiency and/or accuracy.},

The model enriches a standard reduced order modelling (ROM) approach with a wavelet representation. Although the ROM approach reduces the dimensionality of the system of equations, the computational complexity of the integration of the weak form remains problematic. Using a sparse wavelet representation of the required integrands, the computational cost of the assembly of the system of equations is reduced significantly. This wavelet-reduced order model (W-ROM) is applied to the mechanical equilibrium of a microstructural volume as used in a computational homogenisation framework. The reduction technique however is not limited to micro-scale models and can also be applied to macroscopic problems to reduce the computational costs of the integration. For the sake of clarity, the W-ROM will be demonstrated using a one-dimensional example, providing full insight in the underlying steps taken.},

Derivation and implementation of such models have been already made in Finite Element Methods.

This paper fills this gap by presenting formulations of stretch-based material models for isogeometric Kirchhoff-Love shells. We derive general formulations based on explicit treatment in terms of derivatives of the strain energy density functions with respect to principal stretches for (in)compressible material models where determination of eigenvalues as well as the spectral basis transformations is required. Using several numerical benchmarks, we verify our formulations on invariant-based Neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin models and with a stretch-based Ogden model. In addition, the model is applied to simulate collapsing behaviour of a truncated cone and it is used to simulate tension wrinkling of a thin sheet.},

This review recounts the origins of the term, provides a formal definition of the learning curve, and briefly covers basics such as its estimation. Our main contribution is a comprehensive overview of the literature regarding the shape of learning curves. We discuss empirical and theoretical evidence that supports well-behaved curves that often have the shape of a power law or an exponential. We consider the learning curves of Gaussian processes, the complex shapes they can display, and the factors influencing them. We draw specific attention to examples of learning curves that are ill-behaved, showing worse learning performance with more training data. To wrap up, we point out various open problems that warrant deeper empirical and theoretical investigation. All in all, our review underscores that learning curves are surprisingly diverse and no universal model can be identified.},

Such meta-domains are also generated through randomized image manipulations.

  abstract = {Deep transfer learning recently has acquired significant research interest. It makes use of pre-trained models that are learned from a source domain, and utilizes these models for the tasks in a target domain. Model-based deep transfer learning is probably the most frequently used method. However, very little research work has been devoted to enhancing deep transfer learning by focusing on the influence of data. In this paper, we propose an instance-based approach to improve deep transfer learning in a target domain. Specifically, we choose a pre-trained model from a source domain and apply this model to estimate the influence of training samples in a target domain. Then we optimize the training data of the target domain by removing the training samples that will lower the performance of the pre-trained model. We later either fine-tune the pre-trained model with the optimized training data in the target domain, or build a new model which is initialized partially based on the pre-trained model, and fine-tune it with the optimized training data in the target domain. Using this approach, transfer learning can help deep learning models to capture more useful features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on boosting the quality of deep learning models for some common computer vision tasks, such as image classification.},

The constitutive models are conceptualized as information flow in directed graphs. The process of writing constitutive models is simplified as a sequence of forming graph edges with the goal of maximizing the model score (a function of accuracy, robustness and forward prediction quality). Thus meta-modeling can be formulated as a Markov decision process with well-defined states, actions, rules, objective functions and rewards. By using neural networks to estimate policies and state values, the computer agent is able to efficiently self-improve the constitutive model it generated through self-playing, in the same way AlphaGo Zero (the algorithm that outplayed the world champion in the game of Go) improves its gameplay. Our numerical examples show that this automated meta-modeling framework does not only produces models which outperform existing cohesive models on benchmark traction\textendash separation data, but is also capable of detecting hidden mechanisms among micro-structural features and incorporating them in constitutive models to improve the forward prediction accuracy, both of which are difficult tasks to do manually.},

Recently, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this paper, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimized is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.},

In this paper, we first aim to answer the following question: Does GBML with DNNs have global convergence guarantees? We provide a positive answer to this question by proving that GBML with overparameterized DNNs is guaranteed to converge to global optima at a linear rate. The second question we aim to address is: How does GBML achieve fast adaption to new tasks with prior experience on past tasks? To answer it, we theoretically show that GBML is equivalent to a functional gradient descent operation that explicitly propagates experience from the past tasks to new ones, and then we prove a generalization error bound of GBML with over-parameterized DNNs.},

However, despite their noticeable empirical success, little is known about how such constrained neural networks behave during their training via gradient descent. More importantly, even less is known about why such models sometimes fail to train at all. In this work, we aim to investigate these questions through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK); a kernel that captures the behavior of fully-connected neural networks in the infinite width limit during training via gradient descent. Specifically, we derive the NTK of PINNs and prove that, under appropriate conditions, it converges to a deterministic kernel that stays constant during training in the infinite-width limit. This allows us to analyze the training dynamics of PINNs through the lens of their limiting NTK and find a remarkable discrepancy in the convergence rate of the different loss components contributing to the total training error. To address this fundamental pathology, we propose a novel gradient descent algorithm that utilizes the eigenvalues of the NTK to adaptively calibrate the convergence rate of the total training error. Finally, we perform a series of numerical experiments to verify the correctness of our theory and the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

As a comparison, in addition to the joint training scheme, modern meta-learning allows unseen tasks with limited labels during the test phase, in the hope of fast adaptation over them. Despite the subtle difference between MTL and meta-learning in the problem formulation, both learning paradigms share the same insight that the shared structure between existing training tasks could lead to better generalization and adaptation. In this paper, we take one important step further to understand the close connection between these two learning paradigms, through both theoretical analysis and empirical investigation. Theoretically, we first demonstrate that MTL shares the same optimization formulation with a class of gradient-based meta-learning (GBML) algorithms. We then prove that for over-parameterized neural networks with sufficient depth, the learned predictive functions of MTL and GBML are close. In particular, this result implies that the predictions given by these two models are similar over the same unseen task. Empirically, we corroborate our theoretical findings by showing that, with proper implementation, MTL is competitive against state-of-the-art GBML algorithms on a set of few-shot image classification benchmarks. Since existing GBML algorithms often involve costly second-order bi-level optimization, our first-order MTL method is an order of magnitude faster on large-scale datasets such as miniImageNet. We believe this work could help bridge the gap between these two learning paradigms, and provide a computationally efficient alternative to GBML that also supports fast task adaptation.},

  abstract = {Deep operator networks (DeepONets) are receiving increased attention thanks to their demonstrated capability to approximate nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. However, despite their remarkable early promise, they typically require large training data-sets consisting of paired input-output observations which may be expensive to obtain, while their predictions may not be consistent with the underlying physical principles that generated the observed data. In this work, we propose a novel model class coined as physics-informed DeepONets, which introduces an effective regularization mechanism for biasing the outputs of DeepOnet models towards ensuring physical consistency. This is accomplished by leveraging automatic differentiation to impose the underlying physical laws via soft penalty constraints during model training. We demonstrate that this simple, yet remarkably effective extension can not only yield a significant improvement in the predictive accuracy of DeepOnets, but also greatly reduce the need for large training data-sets. To this end, a remarkable observation is that physics-informed DeepONets are capable of solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) without any paired input-output observations, except for a set of given initial or boundary conditions. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a series of comprehensive numerical studies across various types of PDEs. Strikingly, a trained physics informed DeepOnet model can predict the solution of O(103) timedependent PDEs in a fraction of a second \textendash{} up to three orders of magnitude faster compared a conventional PDE solver.

To test this method, we apply it to determine the material parameters of a nonlinear viscoelastic (poly(vinylalcohol)) hydrogel (PVA). Using the metamodel, we are able to rapidly generate the stress histories for a large set of data points spanning a wide range of material parameters without solving the constitutive model of the PVA gel explicitly. To determine the material parameters, we compare the stress histories predicted by the metamodel with the observed stress histories from laboratory experiments consisting of uniaxial tension cyclic and relaxation tests. The efficiency of the metamodel allows us to determine the material parameters of the constitutive model governing the time-dependent behavior of the PVA gel in a short time. The proposed method shows that there exist many sets of material parameters that can faithfully reproduce the experimental data. Further, our method reveals important relationships between the material parameters in the constitutive model.

That is, the model needs to be re-trained each time the boundary conditions (BCs) and domain shape/size change. This limitation prohibits the application of PINNs to realistic or large-scale engineering problems especially since the costs and efforts associated with their training are considerable.},

An assumption of traditional machine learning methodologies is the training data and testing data are taken from the same domain, such that the input feature space and data distribution characteristics are the same. However, in some real-world machine learning scenarios, this assumption does not hold. There are cases where training data is expensive or difficult to collect. Therefore, there is a need to create high-performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains. This methodology is referred to as transfer learning. This survey paper formally defines transfer learning, presents information on current solutions, and reviews applications applied to transfer learning.

However, leveraging data from other hospitals can be challenging owing to institutional differences with patients and with data coding and capture. Objective To investigate three approaches to learning hospital-specific predictions about the risk of hospitalassociated infection with Clostridium difficile, and perform a comparative analysis of the value of different ways of using external data to enhance hospital-specific predictions. Materials and methods We evaluated each approach on 132 853 admissions from three hospitals, varying in size and location. The first approach was a single-task approach, in which only training data from the target hospital (ie, the hospital for which the model was intended) were used. The second used only data from the other two hospitals. The third approach jointly incorporated data from all hospitals while seeking a solution in the target space. Results The relative performance of the three different approaches was found to be sensitive to the hospital selected as the target. However, incorporating data from all hospitals consistently had the highest performance. Discussion The results characterize the challenges and opportunities that come with (1) using data or models from collections of hospitals without adapting them to the site at which the model will be used, and (2) using only local data to build models for small institutions or rare events. Conclusions We show how external data from other hospitals can be successfully and efficiently incorporated into hospital-specific models.},

However, capturing the nonlinear mechanical behavior of these materials, especially those with complex geometries and under large deformation, can be challenging due to inherent computational complexity. In this work, we propose a data-driven multiscale computational scheme as a possible route to resolve this challenge. We use a neural network to approximate the effective strain energy density as a function of cellular geometry and overall deformation. The network is constructed by ``learning'' from the data generated by finite element calculation of a set of representative volume elements at cellular scales. This effective strain energy density is then used to predict the mechanical responses of cellular materials at larger scales. Compared with direct finite element simulation, the proposed scheme can reduce the computational time up to two orders of magnitude. Potentially, this scheme can facilitate new optimization algorithms for designing cellular materials of highly specific mechanical properties.},

  abstract = {There is a growing demand for the use of machine learning (ML) to derive fast-to-evaluate surrogate models of materials properties. In recent years, a broad array of materials property databases have emerged as part of a digital transformation of materials science. However, recent technological advances in ML are not fully exploited because of the insufficient volume and diversity of materials data. An ML framework called ``transfer learning'' has considerable potential to overcome the problem of limited amounts of materials data. Transfer learning relies on the concept that various property types, such as physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties, are physically interrelated. For a given target property to be predicted from a limited supply of training data, models of related proxy properties are pretrained using sufficient data; these models capture common features relevant to the target task. Repurposing of such machine-acquired features on the target task yields outstanding prediction performance even with exceedingly small data sets, as if highly experienced human experts can make rational inferences even for considerably less experienced tasks. In this study, to facilitate widespread use of transfer learning, we develop a pretrained model library called XenonPy.MDL. In this first release, the library comprises more than 140 000 pretrained models for various properties of small molecules, polymers, and inorganic crystalline materials. Along with these pretrained models, we describe some outstanding successes of transfer learning in different scenarios such as building models with only dozens of materials data, increasing the ability of extrapolative prediction through a strategic model transfer, and so on. Remarkably, transfer learning has autonomously identified rather nontrivial transferability across different properties transcending the different disciplines of materials science; for example, our analysis has revealed underlying bridges between small molecules and polymers and between organic and inorganic chemistry.},

However, a critical challenge in meta-learning is task uncertainty and heterogeneity, which can not be handled via globally sharing knowledge among tasks. In this paper, based on gradient-based meta-learning, we propose a hierarchically structured meta-learning (HSML) algorithm that explicitly tailors the transferable knowledge to different clusters of tasks. Inspired by the way human beings organize knowledge, we resort to a hierarchical task clustering structure to cluster tasks. As a result, the proposed approach not only addresses the challenge via the knowledge customization to different clusters of tasks, but also preserves knowledge generalization among a cluster of similar tasks. To tackle the changing of task relationship, in addition, we extend the hierarchical structure to a continual learning environment. The experimental results show that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both toy-regression and few-shot image classification problems.},

However, the bottleneck of current meta-learning algorithms is the requirement of a large number of meta-training tasks, which may not be accessible in real-world scenarios. To address the challenge that available tasks may not densely sample the space of tasks, we propose to augment the task set through interpolation. By meta-learning with task interpolation (MLTI), our approach effectively generates additional tasks by randomly sampling a pair of tasks and interpolating the corresponding features and labels. Under both gradient-based and metric-based meta-learning settings, our theoretical analysis shows MLTI corresponds to a data-adaptive meta-regularization and further improves the generalization. Empirically, in our experiments on eight datasets from diverse domains including image recognition, pose prediction, molecule property prediction, and medical image classification, we find that the proposed general MLTI framework is compatible with representative meta-learning algorithms and consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art strategies.},

  abstract = {The ability to learn new concepts with small amounts of data is a critical aspect of intelligence that has proven challenging for deep learning methods. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks, for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input. By doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from non-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to both contextual and gradientbased meta-learning algorithms, and apply it in practical settings where applying standard meta-learning has been difficult. Our approach substantially outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms in these settings.},

Many previous neural network-based approaches toward meta-leaming have been based on evolutionary methods. We show how to use gradient descent for meta-leaming in recurrent neural networks. Based on previous work on Fixed-Weight Leaming Neural Networks, we hypothesize that any recurrent network topology and its corresponding leaming algorithm(s) is a potential meta-leaming system. We tested several recurrent neural network topologies and their corresponding forms of Backpropagation for their ability to meta-leam. One of our systems, based on the Long Short-Term Memory neural network developed a leaming algorithm that could leam any two-dimensional quadratic function (from a set of such functions\vphantom\{\} after only 30 training examples.},

However, one disadvantage of the first generation of PINNs is that they usually have limited accuracy even with many training points. Here, we propose a new method, gradient-enhanced physics-informed neural networks (gPINNs), for improving the accuracy and training efficiency of PINNs. gPINNs leverage gradient information of the PDE residual and embed the gradient into the loss function. We tested gPINNs extensively and demonstrated the effectiveness of gPINNs in both forward and inverse PDE problems. Our numerical results show that gPINN performs better than PINN with fewer training points. Furthermore, we combined gPINN with the method of residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR), a method for improving the distribution of training points adaptively during training, to further improve the performance of gPINN, especially in PDEs with solutions that have steep gradients.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (or DNNs) must constantly cope with distribution changes in the input data when the task of interest or the data collection protocol changes. Retraining a network from scratch to combat this issue poses a significant cost. Meta-learning aims to deliver an adaptive model that is sensitive to these underlying distribution changes, but requires many tasks during the meta-training process. In this paper, we propose a tAsk-auGmented actIve meta-LEarning (AGILE) method to efficiently adapt DNNs to new tasks by using a small number of training examples. AGILE combines a meta-learning algorithm with a novel task augmentation technique which we use to generate an initial adaptive model. It then uses Bayesian dropout uncertainty estimates to actively select the most difficult samples when updating the model to a new task. This allows AGILE to learn with fewer tasks and a few informative samples, achieving high performance with a limited dataset. We perform our experiments using the brain cell classification task and compare the results to a plain meta-learning model trained from scratch. We show that the proposed task-augmented meta-learning framework can learn to classify new cell types after a single gradient step with a limited number of training samples. We show that active learning with Bayesian uncertainty can further improve the performance when the number of training samples is extremely small. Using only 1\% of the training data and a single update step, we achieved 90\% accuracy on the new cell type classification task, a 50\% points improvement over a state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a learning paradigm in machine learning and its aim is to leverage useful information contained in multiple related tasks to help improve the generalization performance of all the tasks. In this paper, we give a survey for MTL from the perspective of algorithmic modeling, applications and theoretical analyses. For algorithmic modeling, we give a definition of MTL and then classify different MTL algorithms into five categories, including feature learning approach, low-rank approach, task clustering approach, task relation learning approach and decomposition approach as well as discussing the characteristics of each approach. In order to improve the performance of learning tasks further, MTL can be combined with other learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, active learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-view learning and graphical models. When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, we review online, parallel and distributed MTL models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing to reveal their computational and storage advantages. Many real-world applications use MTL to boost their performance and we review representative works in this paper. Finally, we present theoretical analyses and discuss several future directions for MTL.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical deep-learning neural network (HiDeNN) is systematically developed through the construction of structured deep neural networks (DNNs) in a hierarchical manner, and a special case of HiDeNN for representing Finite Element Method (or HiDeNN-FEM in short) is established. In HiDeNN-FEM, weights and biases are functions of the nodal positions, hence the training process in HiDeNN-FEM includes the optimization of the nodal coordinates. This is the spirit of r-adaptivity, and it increases both the local and global accuracy of the interpolants. By fixing the number of hidden layers and increasing the number of neurons by training the DNNs, rh-adaptivity can be achieved, which leads to further improvement of the accuracy for the solutions. The generalization of rational functions is achieved by the development of three fundamental building blocks of constructing deep hierarchical neural networks. The three building blocks are linear functions, multiplication, and inversion. With these building blocks, the class of deep learning interpolation functions are demonstrated for interpolation theories such as Lagrange polynomials, NURBS, isogeometric, reproducing kernel particle method, and others. In HiDeNNFEM, enrichment functions through the multiplication of neurons is equivalent to the enrichment in standard finite element methods, that is, generalized, extended, and partition of unity finite element methods. Numerical examples performed by HiDeNN-FEM exhibit reduced approximation error compared with the standard FEM. Finally, an outlook for the generalized HiDeNN to high-order continuity for multiple dimensions and topology optimizations are illustrated through the hierarchy of the proposed DNNs.},

  abstract = {Active- and transfer-learning are applied to microscale dynamics of polymer flows for the multiscale discovery of effective constitutive approximations required in viscoelastic flow simulation. The result is macroscopic rheology directly connected to a microstructural model. Micro and macroscale simulations are adaptively coupled by means of Gaussian process regression (GPR) to run the expensive microscale computations only as necessary. This multiscale method is demonstrated with flows of a polymer solution as a model system. At the microscale level dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is employed to model the fluid as a suspension of beadspring micro-structures subjected to steady shear flow. The results yield the non-Newtonian viscosity and the first normal stress difference at strain rates as training data used in a GPR model. DPD parameters are calibrated with respect to experimental data for a real polymer solution. Compliance with these data requires adjustment of the DPD model's cutoff radius, which then becomes a function of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor. The FENE-P model is chosen for the macroscale description using the spectral element method (SEM) to simulate channel flow and flow past a circular cylinder. The DPD results at the lowest possible shear strain rate yield an estimate of the zero-shear rate viscosity, which allows the initiation of the macroscale flow by SEM as a Newtonian fluid. The resulting strain-rate field is surveyed to determine additional shear strain rate sampling points for the DPD system. This new information allows an initial fitting of parameters of the constitutive equation followed by new SEM simulations at the macroscale. Guided by active-learning GPR to select new sampling points, this process continues until convergence is achieved.},

  abstract = {Few-shot learning ability is heavily desired for machine intelligence. By meta-learning a model initialization from training tasks with fast adaptation ability to new tasks, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has achieved remarkable success in a number of few-shot learning applications. However, theoretical understandings on the learning ability of MAML remain absent yet, hindering developing new and more advanced meta learning methods in a principled way. In this work, we solve this problem by theoretically justifying the fast adaptation capability of MAML when applied to new tasks. Specifically, we prove that the learnt meta-initialization can benefit the fast adaptation to new tasks with only a few steps of gradient descent. This result explicitly reveals the benefits of the unique designs in MAML. Then we propose a theory-inspired task similarity aware MAML which clusters tasks into multiple groups according to the estimated optimal model parameters and learns group-specific initializations. The proposed method improves upon MAML by speeding up the adaptation and giving stronger few-shot learning ability. Experimental results on the few-shot classification tasks testify its advantages.},

  abstract = {Few-shot learning remains challenging for metalearning that learns a learning algorithm (metalearner) from many related tasks. In this work, we argue that this is due to the lack of a good representation for meta-learning, and propose deep metalearning to integrate the representation power of deep learning into meta-learning. The framework is composed of three modules, a concept generator, a meta-learner, and a concept discriminator, which are learned jointly. The concept generator, e.g. a deep residual net, extracts a representation for each instance that captures its high-level concept, on which the meta-learner performs fewshot learning, and the concept discriminator recognizes the concepts. By learning to learn in the concept space rather than in the complicated instance space, deep meta-learning can substantially improve vanilla meta-learning, which is demonstrated on various few-shot image recognition problems. For example, on 5-way-1-shot image recognition on CIFAR-100 and CUB-200, it improves Matching Nets from 50.53\% and 56.53\% to 58.18\% and 63.47\%, improves MAML from 49.28\% and 50.45\% to 56.65\% and 64.63\%, and improves Meta-SGD from 53.83\% and 53.34\% to 61.62\% and 66.95\%, respectively.},

In this way, the dependence on a large number of target domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning researches, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey paper reviews more than forty representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over twenty representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different datasets, i.e., Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31. And the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

The DAEM exploits the higher order continuity of the DAEM and integrates a deep autoencoder and the minimum total potential principle in one framework yielding an unsupervised feature learning method. The DAEM is a specific type of feedforward deep neural network (DNN) and can also serve as function approximator. With robust feature extraction capacity, the DAEM can more efficiently identify patterns behind the whole energy system, such as the field variables, natural frequency and critical buckling load factor studied in this paper. The objective function is to minimize the total potential energy. The DAEM performs unsupervised learning based on generated collocation points inside the physical domain so that the total potential energy is minimized at all points. For the vibration and buckling analysis, the loss function is constructed based on Rayleigh's principle and the fundamental frequency and the critical buckling load is extracted. A scaled hyperbolic tangent activation function for the underlying mechanical model is presented which meets the continuity requirement and alleviates the gradient vanishing/explosive problems under bending. The DAEM is implemented using Pytorch and the LBFGS optimizer. To further improve the computational efficiency and enhance the generality of this machine learning method, we employ transfer learning. A comprehensive study of the DAEM configuration is performed for several numerical examples with various geometries, load conditions, and boundary conditions.},

Instrumented indentation of hyperelastic materials such as rubbers, bio-materials, tissues etc has not been examined in depth, especially the inverse problem of material characterization from instrumented indentation response. The difficulty of the inverse problem for such materials is that the unknown property is a function, the elastic energy density function. There are several such functions and each function is often characterized by more than one parameter. If the maximum indentation depth is low, we have shown that instrumented indentation of initially unstretched hyperelastic materials can only resolve a combination of the material parameters. If the maximum indentation depth is high, the indentation can provide independent material properties, however not in a unique way. Moreover, high indentation loads could lead to surface puncturing and so blur the test results. In this work, we show that we can use spherical indentation of a substrate at different but known prestretch levels to obtain the involved material properties of the energy density function. The present methodology can also incorporate a limit energy failure criterion and instrumented indentation can incorporate this behavior which we may call indentation strength.},
